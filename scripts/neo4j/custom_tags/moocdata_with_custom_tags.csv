Every project and every team uses a custom agile methodology. This course discusses common foundational principles and practices used by agile methodologies, providing the student a flexible set of tools to use in any role (e.g. product owner, scrum master, project manager, team member) on any agile team. This course mainly discusses agile and lean principles, the kanban and scrum agile methodologies, and uses Atlassian Jira Software Cloud as the main software tool to apply hands-on learning of the topics. The course includes instruction on ""classic"" Jira projects as well as the new ""next-gen"" Jira projects.Students are provided with a free Atlassian Jira Software Cloud account in order to complete the hands-on labs associated with this course. By the time you have completed this course, you will have a strong foundational understanding of agile principles and practices, and strong hands-on experience with Atlassian Jira Software Cloud. You will be the site administrator for your Jira account, so you will be able to perform basic administration tasks on your site. You should be able to continuously configure your Jira project(s) to match your team's custom agile methodology.You can watch the videos and take the quizzes from your phone if you want, but the hands-on labs using Atlassian Jira Software Cloud require you to have a Windows, Mac or Linux computer.This course tries to be as concise as possible. It will probably take you about 6-12 hours to go through, but your mileage may vary. It is highly encouraged that you apply what you learn to managing personal agile projects after the course is complete.","WEEK 1AGILE OVERVIEW IThis module provides an overview of the agile mindset. It introduces Atlassian Jira as a tool used to implement agile principles for team project work. Students will be provided a free Jira Software Cloud license in order to go through the hands-on exercises in this course. We cover the importance of visualizing work, and provide an overview of the kanban agile method. Students will create a custom kanban board.WEEK 2Agile Overview IIThis module start with an overview of scrum, including scrum concepts such as increments, sprints, sprint goals, backlogs, estimation, velocity, common scrum reports, roles and events. You will then execute a sprint using Jira. The rest of the module focuses more on the ""why"" of agile, and provided a foundational understanding of lean and agile principles. The Toyota Production System is discussed, as this could be considered as the foundation of lean thinking. The Agile Manifesto is also discussed in quite some detail.WEEK 3Configure Jira IThis module focuses on configuring Jira to match your agile process. This is a more hands-on module than the previous module. Every team has a unique, continuously evolving agile process. Their tools need to be able to adapt to these changes. We will start by discussing searching, then discuss Jira Query Language (JQL). A solid understanding of JQL helps with the rest of the course and in your continuing use of Jira after the course. We will discuss creating filter, custom issue types and configuring issues to show the information that your team cares about.WEEK 4Configure Jira IIIn this module, we continue configuring Jira in order to be able to match the tool to our team's custom agile process. We will discuss and create epics, which are large issues that may contain other issues. We will discuss and create versions, which are a set of issues that usually make up a product update. We discuss users and permissions. Since you are the administrator of the free Jira Software Cloud that you use for this course, you should know how to invite users to your site and configure permissions so that the right access is granted to users. We end the course with a final project. You will be asked to configure Jira to keep up with your team's continuous changes",Free Online Course (Audit),Upcoming,English,"25th Mar, 2019",2-4 hours a week,4 weeks long,"[""Steve Byrnes""]"
https://www.classcentral.com/course/coursera-advanced-algorithms-and-complexity-5474,Advanced Algorithms and Complexity,"University of California, San Diego",Coursera,Algorithms and Data Structures,"""algorithm design, algorithm analysis""","You've learned the basic algorithms now and are ready to step into the area of more complex problems and algorithms to solve them. Advanced algorithms build upon basic ones and use new ideas. We will start with networks flows which are used in more typical applications such as optimal matchings, finding disjoint paths and flight scheduling as well as more surprising ones like image segmentation in computer vision. We then proceed to linear programming with applications in optimizing budget allocation, portfolio optimization, finding the cheapest diet satisfying all requirements and many others. Next we discuss inherently hard problems for which no exact good solutions are known (and not likely to be found) and how to solve them in practice. We finish with a soft introduction to streaming algorithms that are heavily used in Big Data processing. Such algorithms are usually designed to be able to process huge datasets without being able even to store a dataset.","Flows in NetworksNetwork flows show up in many real world situations in which a good needs to be transported across a network with limited capacity. You can see it when shipping goods across highways and routing packets across the internet. In this unit, we will discuss the mathematical underpinnings of network flows and some important flow algorithms. We will also give some surprising examples on seemingly unrelated problems that can be solved with our knowledge of network flows.Linear ProgrammingLinear programming is a very powerful algorithmic tool. Essentially, a linear programming problem asks you to optimize a linear function of real variables constrained by some system of linear inequalities. This is an extremely versatile framework that immediately generalizes flow problems, but can also be used to discuss a wide variety of other problems from optimizing production procedures to finding the cheapest way to attain a healthy diet. Surprisingly, this very general framework admits efficient algorithms. In this unit, we will discuss some of the importance of linear programming problems along with some of the tools used to solve them.NP-complete ProblemsAlthough many of the algorithms you've learned so far are applied in practice a lot, it turns out that the world is dominated by real-world problems without a known provably efficient algorithm. Many of these problems can be reduced to one of the classical problems called NP-complete problems which either cannot be solved by a polynomial algorithm or solving any one of them would win you a million dollars (see Millenium Prize Problems) and eternal worldwide fame for solving the main problem of computer science called P vs NP. It's good to know this before trying to solve a problem before the tomorrow's deadline :) Although these problems are very unlikely to be solvable efficiently in the nearest future, people always come up with various workarounds. In this module you will study the classical NP-complete problems and the reductions between them. You will also practice solving large instances of some of these problems despite their hardness using very efficient specialized software based on tons of research in the area of NP-complete problems.Coping with NP-completenessAfter the previous module you might be sad: you've just went through 5 courses in Algorithms only to learn that they are not suitable for most real-world problems. However, don't give up yet! People are creative, and they need to solve these problems anyway, so in practice there are often ways to cope with an NP-complete problem at hand. We first show that some special cases on NP-complete problems can, in fact, be solved in polynomial time. We then consider exact algorithms that find a solution much faster than the brute force algorithm. We conclude with approximation algorithms that work in polynomial time and find a solution that is close to being optimal. Streaming Algorithms (Optional)In most previous lectures we were interested in designing algorithms with fast (e.g. small polynomial) runtime, and assumed that the algorithm has random access to its input, which is loaded into memory. In many modern applications in big data analysis, however, the input is so large that it cannot be stored in memory. Instead,  the input is presented as a stream of updates, which the algorithm scans while maintaining a small summary of the stream seen so far. This is precisely the setting of the streaming model of computation, which we study in this lecture. The streaming model is well-suited for designing and reasoning about small space algorithms. It has received a lot of attention in the literature, and several powerful algorithmic primitives for computing basic stream statistics in this model have been designed, several of them impacting the practice of big data analysis. In this lecture we will see one such algorithm (CountSketch), a small space algorithm for finding the top k most frequent items in a data stream.",Free Online Course (Audit),In progress,English,"18th Mar, 2019",N/A,5 weeks long,"[""Alexander S.

Then consider joining this course to gain skills in one of the most popular Single Page Application (SPA) frameworks today, AngularJS. Developed and backed by Google, AngularJS is a very marketable skill to acquire.In this course, we will explore the core design of AngularJS 1.x (latest version of AngularJS 1), its components and code organization techniques. We will enhance the functionality of our web app by utilizing dependency injection to reuse existing services as well as write our own. We will create reusable HTML components that take advantage of AngularJS data binding as well as extend HTML syntax with a very powerful feature of AngularJS called directives. We’ll set up routing so our SPA can have multiple views. We will also learn how to unit test our functionality. At the end of this course, you will build a fully functional, well organized and tested web application using AngularJS and deploy it to the cloud.","Introduction to AngularJSIn this module, we are going to start by going over how grading works for this course, will introduce some recommended books, as well as give you the information on how to find all of the source code that you will see throughout the course.We will then dive into the development environment setup for both Mac and Windows.The core of this module will be the introduction not only to the basics of AngularJS, but more importantly, the concepts that back AngularJS as a good solution for developing front-end web applications.To become a good software developer and not just with AngularJS, you will need to understand these concepts. But for becoming a good AngularJS developer, these concepts are essential, because they will allow you to understand the issues the framework is addressing and therefore get a good grasp on the solutions AngularJS is offering.Module 2 - Filters, Digest Cycle, Controller Inheritance, and Custom ServicesWe will start this module by learning how to use Angular filters to manipulate our data into the format we want and learn how to create our own custom filters. We will then dive deep into the digest cycle, which is the process AngularJS uses to magically update our web page with the bound data from our ViewModel or the controller. Understanding this process is crucial in getting comfortable with AngularJS. We'll also see some cases where we'll need to assist that process somewhat and understand why that is. After that, we'll learn one of the most fundamental concepts in the Javascript programming language, which is Prototypal Inheritance. Clear understanding of that topic is a must before we talk about inheritance between AngularJS controllers in our application. We'll finish off the module by learning how to create our own custom Angular services as well as how to configure them. With custom Angular services we'll be able to share data across different controllers or other components in our application. We will also learn a few useful Angular directives that allow us to place looping and conditional logic direction into our HTML. You'll see that by the end of this module, you'll have the skills to create a fairly sophisticated web application that starts to use some of the more advanced software architecture techniques.Week 3 - Promises, Ajax, and Custom DirectivesWelcome to module 3! In this module, we go over a lot of essential features of AngularJS. We will start with learning about the Promise API. While Promises are essential to Angular, this topic reaches far beyond Angular. It's really an essential topic to understanding modern web development with Javascript. We will also learn about making calls to the server through the built in Angular service called the HTTP service. We'll finish off the module by spending a considerable amount of time on THE crown feature of AngularJS: directives. Directives are really at the core of the entire framework. They not only allow us to extend the functionality of existing HTML elements, which is already pretty amazing in an of itself, but they also allow us to create our own element with custom view and custom behavior. Pretty exciting stuff! Module 4 - Components, Events, Modules, and RoutingIn this module, we start by introducing the idea of Component-based architecture. We will then delve into the AngularJS component API. The component API is something that was just recently added into Angular 1 and it's not only supposed to improve your application through the use of Component-based architecture, but also prepare you for an upgrade to Angular version 2, which uses components almost exclusively. We will then learn about the AngularJS event system and how to split up our application into smaller modules that can then be glued together to produce our final application. We'll finish off the module by diving fairly deep into Routing between views in your application and, specifically, into the use of the ui-router module, which is one of the most popular open source routing solutions within the AngularJS ecosystem. In fact, it's so popular that even the main Google documentation for routing in Angular links to ui-router. Routing is a very important topic. Without it, your Single Page Application is stuck displaying just 1 view, without an elegant way to display other views.Module 5 - Form Validation, Testing, and Restaurant Site DevelopmentWelcome to module 5! This is the last module in the course. We'll start this module by learning just how easy it is to validate forms with Angular. We will then delve into unit testing our AngularJS code. We will go over how to set up tests for every type of major Angular artifact: controller, service, directive, and component, as well as how to test services that access the network through the HTTP service. However, the last part of the module is the most fun. We will take the site that was developed for our real client in my previous course and re-write the entire thing using AngularJS. However, the coding fun doesn't have to stop there. After you finish the required part of the course, you can move on to the optional bonus part where we take our newly developed AngularJS application and enhance with it even more features that will allow the restaurant owners to administer their own data.

But before you share your apps on the Internet you should protect your users' data, ensuring information stored on your site is safe from unwanted manipulation. You could implement web security and permissions on your own, but relying on trusted providers is a faster, safer, and easier way to allow users to login to your application - without having to create and maintain another account, profile, and password. In this course, you will learn to implement the OAuth 2.0 framework to allow users to securely login to your web applications. You'll be provided a  restaurant menu application created in Flask. By the end of this course, you will write the necessary code to implement Google+ Sign-In and Facebook Login in options so users can create restaurant menus that are viewable by everyone but only modifiable by the original creator.Why Take This Course?OAuth 2.0 is a popular framework that allows users to login to your web application by using  third party sign ins, from providers they've already created and trust, with the click of a button.

Your users can then control the level of access your application has to their data, and change or revoke this access at any point in time.","Lesson 1 - Authentication vs. AuthorizationLearn the difference between the concepts of authentication and authorization and address some major security concerns that developers must protect against when developing a web application.  You will learn how OAuth 2.0 makes implementing security easier for developers and users alike by allowing your users to sign in to your applications while keeping all of the security on well-known and trusted OAuth providers. Finally, you will see OAuth 2.0 in action as you make API requests using Google's OAuth 2.0 Playground.Lesson 2 - Creating a Google+ Sign-InLearn about the different types of security flows your application can implement. You will see how security can be handled by your server, your user's browser, or both depending on the type of security your application needs.  You will then add a Google+ Sign-In to an existing web application and implement a hybridized client/server flow.Lesson 3 - Local Permission SystemsAdd python code to create server-side rules that will constitute a permission system. This system will limit access of the database for each logged in user based on how the developer designs this code. You will add a User model model to your database to store the credentials, such as username, email, and profile picture, collected from the OAuth provider's API.Lesson 4 - Adding Facebook & Other ProvidersLearn to implement multiple OAuth providers on your web application.

In this course you will learn how to style your pages by taking advantage of the power of CSS3.   We will focus on both proper syntax (how to write your styling rules) and the importance of accessibility design (making sure that your style enhances your site, not make it harder to navigate).  It is so important that you jump in ready to make mistakes and typos in this course.  The only way you will really understand the material is to practice typing it in on your own as often as possible.Week Two: Advanced StylingColors and fonts are just the start to styling your page.  The nice thing about starting with these properties is that they are usually very straightforward to implement.  You pick a color and boom - instant, expected results.  This week we move on to new properties that tend to require a little bit of tweaking to get the desired results.  In particular we will talk about the Box Model, background images, opacity, float, columns, visibility, and designing for different browsers.Week Three:  Psuedo-classes, Pseudo-elements, Transitions, and PositioningHave you ever noticed on a web page that some links are blue and others are purple, depending upon if you have clicked on the links?  How is it possible to style some anchor tags and not others?  This week you will learn how to style pseudo-classes (e.g. a link that has been visiting, an element that has the mouse hovering over it) and pseudo-elements (e.g. the first-letter of a heading, the first line of a paragraph).  These elements are not difficult to style, but do require careful coding.  It is also the first step to adding simple animation to your site.  We end this week with the subject of positioning -- how to get elements to stick to a certain part of your page.  Think about annoying pop-up ads.

This course will teach you three techniques for storing data to your device’s hard drive: NSUserPreferences for small amounts of data, the Sandbox for files and Core Data when you have to play in the Big Leagues!Why Take This Course?Just like computers, your iPhone has two types of memory: main memory (RAM) and the hard drive. In all the apps you’ve written, you’ve interacted with RAM, but this memory is limited, and it’s important that the apps you design use it as efficiently as possible. To use the RAM efficiently it is important to be able to store data on the hard drive.It is also important for your apps to maintain state when they are turned off. The apps you’ve built probably aren’t persistent, meaning that they don’t save their state to the device’s hard drive. As RAM is volatile, data is lost when the app stops running. In this course, you’ll learn how to persist the state of the device using NSUserDefaults and Core Data.","Lesson 1: Simple PersistenceIn this lesson, you’ll learn about simple persistence and how to save small pieces of data, like user preferences, using NSUserDefaults.Lesson 2: The iOS File SystemIn this lesson, we’ll discuss the iOS File System, the ""sandbox"", and how to access these files using NSFileManager.Lesson 3: Comprehensive Persistence: Core Data (Part 1)IIn this lesson, you’ll be introduced to the Core Data framework, Apple’s favorite framework for the model class.

Do you find yourself copying and pasting lines of code over and over throughout your application? Surely there’s a better way, right? Yes, there is a better way -- object-oriented programming will allow you to build websites using reusable blocks of code known as libraries, similar to using bricks to build a house. This course is designed to teach web developers how to utilize the various object-oriented programming features within JavaScript, and more importantly, how to write reusable and maintainable libraries that will make your life easier.Why Take This Course?As a Front-End Web Developer, JavaScript is one of the most important languages in your toolbox. A strong foundation in the language’s features empowers you to write efficient and performant web applications. In this course you’ll explore a variety of ways to write object-oriented code in JavaScript.You’ll build a variety of JavaScript objects and explore how their different inheritance models affect your code’s execution and in-memory model. You’ll use these features to write memory efficient code and seek simplicity and modularity in your own code.","Lesson 1: Scopes and ClosuresWe’ll start by discussing JavaScript’s functional variable scoping features, including lexical scopes (variable availability as you write your code) and dynamics scopes (variable availability as your code actively runs). We’ll then discuss closures, an often misunderstood but incredibly useful feature available in only a handful of languages, including JavaScript.Lesson 2: The Keyword ""this""You’ll start your dive into JavaScript object-oriented features by first discovering the parameter ""this"". You’ll learn how the value of ""this"" is determined within various code structures and why it might be a lot easier to think of ""this"" as a parameter rather than a keyword.Lesson 3: Prototype DelegationYou’re probably using one of JavaScript’s inheritance models already: prototype delegation! In this lesson you’ll learn more about this unique feature of JavaScript, how JavaScript uses this feature internally and how you can take advantage of it to maximize your application’s memory footprint.Lesson 4: Code ReuseThere are numerous ways to write concise, maintainable and reusable code in JavaScript and you’ll practice a number of them in this lesson. We’ll start writing a library using basic functions and learn the decorator pattern. Then, we’ll refactor this library into the functional, prototypal and pseudoclassical inheritance models.

Separating concerns can be done with or without an organizational library or framework. We’ll learn how to separate concerns without one, and then we’ll explore an organizational library together. You’ll also learn strategies for exploring other libraries and frameworks on your own.By the end of this course, you’ll understand (from experience) the importance of code organization, and how to implement it with either vanilla JavaScript or an organizational library or framework. Your applications will start looking clean and professional—not just to your users, but also to anyone who looks at the code driving your applications.Why Take This Course?Many developers dive right into projects without thinking of the organization or structure of the code they’re writing. It's easy to hack projects together, but the best developers spend the extra time to think about the organization of their application and adhere to sound organizational practices.In order to write clean code that will get you your next job or promotion, you'll need to have a solid understanding of organizational techniques, and you'll need to implement those techniques in your projects. Software developers who write clean and organized code are surprisingly hard to find, so if you can master code organization you’ll be a step above the rest.","Lesson 1: Changing ExpectationsWe'll first start by building a project the way you already know how: without an overarching organizational paradigm. Specifically, we'll discuss pain points and difficulties that are easy to run into when you don't use an organizational model. Then, we'll discuss a paradigm that will help us in the future, and we’ll see some examples of that paradigm in action.Lesson 2: RefactoringWe'll spend some time discussing how our new paradigm applies to the project we worked on in Lesson 1. Then we'll rebuild the project with the new organizational paradigm.Lesson 3: Using an Organizational LibraryWe'll explore how to use KnockoutJS, an organizational library, to organize our code and to reduce the amount of boilerplate code we write. Our resulting application will be well-organized, easy to understand, and extendable.Lesson 4: Exploring Unfamiliar CodeIn this final lesson, we'll spend some time talking about how to explore code that you didn't write, possibly even using a library or framework that you aren't familiar with.

In this course, you will create relational databases, write SQL statements to extract information to satisfy business reporting requests, create entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) to design databases, and analyze table designs for excessive redundancy. As you develop these skills, you will use either Oracle or MySQL to execute SQL statements and a database diagramming tool such as the ER Assistant or Visual Paradigm to create ERDs. We’ve designed this course to ensure a common foundation for specialization learners. Everyone taking the course can jump right in with writing SQL statements in Oracle or MySQL.","Course IntroductionModule 1 provides the context for Database Management Essentials. When you’re done, you’ll understand the objectives for the course and know what topics and assignments to expect. Keeping these course objectives in mind will help you succeed throughout the course! You should read about the database software requirements in the last lesson of module 1. I recommend that you try to install the DBMS software this week before assignments begin in week 2.Introduction to Databases and DBMSsWe’ll launch into an exploration of databases and database technology and their impact on organizations in Module 2. We’ll investigate database characteristics, database technology features, including non-procedural access, two key processing environments, and an evolution of the database software industry. This short informational module will ensure that we all have the same background and context, which is critical for success in the later modules that emphasize details and hands-on skills.Relational Data Model and the CREATE TABLE StatementNow that you have the informational context for database features and environments, you’ll start building! In this module, you’ll learn relational data model terminology, integrity rules, and the CREATE TABLE statement. You’ll apply what you’ve learned in practice and graded problems using a database management system (DBMS), either Oracle or MySQL, creating tables using the SQL CREATE TABLE statement and populating your tables using given SQL INSERT statements.Basic Query Formulation with SQLThis module is all about acquiring query formulation skills. Now that you know the relational data model and have basic skills with the CREATE TABLE statement, we can cover basic syntax of the SQL SELECT statement and the join operator for combining tables. SELECT statement examples are presented for single table conditions, join operations, and grouping operations. You’ll practice writing simple SELECT statements using the tables that you created in the assignment for module 3.Extended Query Formulation with SQLNow that you can identify and use the SELECT statement and the join operator, you’ll extend your problem solving skills in this module so you can gain confidence on more complex queries. You will work on retrieval problems with multiple tables and grouping. In addition, you’ll learn to use the UNION operator in the SQL SELECT statement and write SQL modification statements.Notation for Entity Relationship DiagramsModule 6 represents another shift in your learning. In previous modules, you’ve created and populated tables and developed query formulation skills using the SQL SELECT statement. Now you’ll start to develop skills that allow you to create a database design to support business requirements. You’ll learn basic notation used in entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), a graphical notation for data modeling. You will create simple ERDs using basic diagram symbols and relationship variations to start developing your data modeling skills. ERD Rules and Problem SolvingModule 7 builds on your knowledge of database development using basic ERD symbols and relationship variations. We’ll be practicing precise usage of ERD notation and basic problem solving skills. You will learn about diagram rules and work problems to help you gain confidence using and creating ERDs.Developing Business Data ModelsIn Module 8, you’ll use your ERD notation skills and your ability to avoid diagram errors to develop ERDs that satisfy specific business data requirements. You will learn and practice powerful problem-solving skills as you analyze narrative statements and transformations to generate alternative ERDs.Data Modeling Problems and Completion of an ERDNow that you have practiced data modeling techniques, you’ll get to wrestle with narrative problem analyses and transformations for generating alternative database designs in Module 9. At the end of this module, you’ll learn guidelines for documentation and detection of design errors that will serve you well as you design databases for business situations.Schema ConversionModules 6 to 9 covered conceptual data modeling, emphasizing precise usage of ERD notation, analysis of narrative problems, and generation of alternative designs. Modules 10 and 11 cover logical database design, the next step in the database development process. In Module 10, we’ll cover schema conversion, the first step in the logical database design phase. You will learn to convert an ERD into a table design that can be implemented on a relational DBMS.Normalization Concepts and PracticeModule 11 covers normalization, the second part of the logical database design process. Normalization provides tools to remove unwanted redundancy in a table design. You’ll discover the motivation for normalization, constraints to reason about unwanted redundancy, and rules that detect excessive redundancy in a table design. You’ll practice integrating and applying normalization techniques in the final lesson of this course.",Free Online Course (Audit),In progress,English,"18th Mar, 2019",N/A,7 weeks long,"[""Michael Mannino""]"

We search for information using textual queries, we read websites, books, e-mails. All those are strings from the point of view of computer science. To make sense of all that information and make search efficient, search engines use many string algorithms. Moreover, the emerging field of personalized medicine uses many search algorithms to find disease-causing mutations in the human genome.","Suffix TreesHow would you search for a longest repeat in a string in LINEAR time? In 1973, Peter Weiner came up with a surprising solution that was based on suffix trees, the key data structure in pattern matching.  Computer scientists were so impressed with his algorithm that they called it the Algorithm of the Year.  In this lesson, we will explore some key ideas for pattern matching that will - through a series of trials and errors - bring us to suffix trees.Burrows-Wheeler Transform and Suffix ArraysAlthough EXACT pattern matching with suffix trees is fast, it is not clear how to use suffix trees for APPROXIMATE pattern matching.  In 1994, Michael Burrows and David Wheeler invented an ingenious algorithm for text compression that is now known as Burrows-Wheeler Transform. They knew nothing about genomics, and they could not have imagined that 15 years later their algorithm will become the workhorse of biologists searching for genomic mutations. But what text compression has to do with pattern matching??? In this lesson you will learn that the fate of an algorithm is often hard to predict – its applications may appear in a field that has nothing to do with the original plan of its inventors.Knuth–Morris–Pratt AlgorithmCongratulations, you have now learned the key pattern matching concepts: tries, suffix trees, suffix arrays and even the Burrows-Wheeler transform! However, some of the results Pavel mentioned remain mysterious: e.g., how can we perform exact pattern matching in O(|Text|) time rather than in O(|Text|*|Pattern|) time as in the naïve brute force algorithm? How can it be that matching a 1000-nucleotide pattern against the human genome is nearly as fast as matching a 3-nucleotide pattern??? Also, even though Pavel showed how to quickly construct the suffix array given the suffix tree, he has not revealed the magic behind the fast algorithms for the suffix tree construction!In this module, Miсhael will address some algorithmic challenges that Pavel tried to hide from you :) such as the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for exact pattern matching and more efficient algorithms for suffix tree and suffix array construction.Constructing Suffix Arrays and Suffix TreesIn this module we continue studying algorithmic challenges of the string algorithms. You will learn an O(n log n) algorithm for suffix array construction and a linear time algorithm for construction of suffix tree from a suffix array.

We start by learning the mathematical definition of distance and use this to motivate the use of the singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimension reduction and multi-dimensional scaling and its connection to principle component analysis. We will learn about the batch effect: the most challenging data analytical problem in genomics today and describe how the techniques can be used to detect and adjust for batch effects. Specifically, we will describe the principal component analysis and factor analysis and demonstrate how these concepts are applied to data visualization and data analysis of high-throughput experimental data.Finally, we give a brief introduction to machine learning and apply it to high-throughput data. We describe the general idea behind clustering analysis and descript K-means and hierarchical clustering and demonstrate how these are used in genomics and describe prediction algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors along with the concepts of training sets, test sets, error rates and cross-validation.Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/udacity-intro-to-point-click-app-development-1481,Intro to Point & Click App Development,Salesforce,Udacity,Web Development,"""salesforce""","This class teaches you how to build powerful web and mobile apps and host them in the cloud, without writing a line of code.By the end of this short course, you'll use the skills you've developed to conceptualize and create your own app. To get you there, your instructors Samantha and Andy will first help you build an app that could be used to manage logistics at a music festival. Though this is a very specific app use case, the skills you learn will be applicable to just about any business app you’d want to develop.Why Take This Course?After completing this course you will have built your own web and mobile app. You will become familiar with the concept of abstraction and how to think about concrete problems in their most general sense -- a concept critical for all developers. In addition, you will learn how to map out a data model, create data visualizations, and automate manual processes after analyzing your abstractions.What kind of apps can you build? Well, Facebook uses a Salesforce app to manage their entire hire-to-retire process: collecting resumes, sharing feedback, making job offers, and developing talent. And the Obama 2012 campaign built apps to mobilize their vast volunteer network and visualize the pulse of the nation in real-time. What will you build?","OverviewIn this class you’ll learn the basics of building apps with Force.com, a part of Salesforce Platform. These apps are typically business apps: they solve organizational and logistical problems. You probably wouldn’t use Salesforce to build a computer game (though you could!).There are two ways to build apps in Force.com: with or without code. This class will only cover the non-coding, point-and-click app building interface. But don’t be fooled! Building powerful apps does not require writing code. This class contains an introductory lesson, five primary lessons where you'll be building and learning (each of which has an accompanying problem set to practice your skills), and a final project where you'll put everything together.Lesson 0: What is Salesforce (15 mins)What is Salesforce Platform? What does it do? Why should I learn about it? What kind of jobs can I get after I learn how to use it?In this lesson, you’ll meet the instructors, get to know the class, and learn a bit about Salesforce in general. Lesson 1: Creating your First App (90 minutes)In this lesson you’ll get acquainted with Force.com and actually build the beginnings of your first app. You’ll get some experience taking a big problem (in this case, managing a music festival), breaking it into smaller parts, and representing those parts in Salesforce. As you do this, you’ll learn about the basic components of a Salesforce app and add some simple (but powerful) functionality to your app. More concretely, you’ll learn about:Salesforce Data: Salesforce represents data as objects, fields, and records. You’ll learn what these terms mean and build them into your app. Relationships: When the pieces of your app start communicating, interesting things can happen. In this lesson you’ll learn the basics of Salesforce relationship fields. Validation Rules: If you’ve ever incorrectly entered your credit card number into a website, you already know about validation rules. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to build them into your app. Formulas and Summaries: These tools let you easily keep track of quantifiable things like money spent, customers contacted, or tickets sold. In this lesson you’ll learn how to build these automated calculations into your app.Lesson 2: Building out your Data Model (90 mins)Behind every powerful business app is a well-planned data model (also known as a schema). In this lesson you’ll learn how to decompose a complex problem into its component pieces and then connect those pieces together with the appropriate relationship fields. The data model you build will serve as the schematic skeleton onto which you’ll build dynamic functionality in later lessons. The specific topics covered are: One-to-Many Relationships: These relationships let the pieces of your app talk to each other. In this lesson you’ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build. Many-to-Many Relationships: You’ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model. Customizing the User Interface: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson you’ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive.Schema Builder: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce. In this lesson you’ll start using the schema builder to understand how your app works.Data Loading: This is a convenient way to get lots of data onto your app at once.Lesson 3: Visualizing your Data (45 mins)No matter what kind of app you’re building, you’ve probably got some data that you want other people in your organization to understand quickly and easily. In this lesson you’ll learn how quickly communicate information with  real-time data visualizations. Specifically, you’ll learn how to make:Reports: These let you gather related information into one place.  These let you gather data according to specific criteria and display it in neat rows and columns. Charts: These let you graphically summarize the information in a report.Dashboards: Different people want access to different information. A dashboard is a collection of charts that give specific people in your organization exactly the information that they need in real-time.Views: Data is good, but sometimes you have too much. Views let you selectively and quickly display only the data you care about.Lesson 4: Adding Automation (45 mins)In this lesson you’ll think about how to use your app to automate manual tasks. You’ll learn how to use two important Salesforce tools: Workflows: There are situations where a series of steps need to happen in sequence: first do this, then do that. Workflows let you automate processes like these, such as sending an email, assigning a task, or updating a field.Approval Processes: You don’t want every job to be completely automated. Sometimes you need someone to step in and say ""this looks good."" Approval processes add a human element to your automated tasks.Lesson 5: Make it Social. Make it Mobile. (45 mins)This is it. With a few clicks of the mouse you’ll make your app social and mobile. The tools you’ll use are:Chatter: This will let your users collaborate on the projects and records they work on together.Salesforce1: That web app you’ve been building this whole time? It’s actually a mobile app too. You’ll even learn how to quickly customize your mobile interface and add functionality for mobile productivity. Final Project: Build your own App (2-4 hours)By the time you get here, you will have already built a music festival management app. Now it’s time to take your own idea and turn it into a functional web and mobile app.",Free Online Course,Self Paced,English,Self paced,N/A,4 weeks long,"[""Mario Korf"",""Samantha Ready""]"

And more importantly - you will learn how to harness the power of App Engine - Platform as a Service, run by Google, so you can focus on your application's features, not on managing infrastructure that runs your app. Let Google run and scale the infrastructure and do what you do best - write code! However, to use App Engine effectively, you have to learn how it works, and this is exactly what this course will teach! You will also learn the best practices of using Cloud Endpoints that allow you to easily create API services and make them accessible to iOS, Android and Javascript clients. They allow you to automatically generate client libraries to make wiring up the frontend easy. And there are some nifty built-in features, like denial-of-service protection and OAuth 2.0 support.Why Take This Course?Cloud computing is one of the fastest growing fields right now. And no wonder - it provides an easy and affordable way to run your applications. However, the traditional way of hosting and scaling applications on Virtual Machines in the Cloud comes with a cost - even if the infrastructure is virtual, you still have to manage it - do load balancing, bring instances up and down, take care of patching your software and in general spend a lot of your time and resources on just the infrastructure. Google is one of the pioneers in the business of scaling, and now you can use their infrastructure, and let them do all the scaling work so that you can focus on the unique features your app provides.Are you a Java developer? If so, maybe you'd like to check out our Developing Scalable Apps with Java course.ProjectThere will be an overarching project throughout the course, starting from Lesson 2.

How does an internet router forward packets of network traffic to minimize delay?  How does an aid group allocate resources to its affiliated local partners?To solve such problems, we first represent the key pieces of data in a complex data structure. In this course, you’ll learn about data structures, like graphs, that are fundamental for working with structured real world data.  You will develop, implement, and analyze algorithms for working with this data to solve real world problems.   In addition, as the programs you develop in this course become more complex, we’ll examine what makes for good code and class hierarchy design so that you can not only write correct code, but also share it with other people and maintain it in the future.The backbone project in this course will be a route planning application.  You will apply the concepts from each Module directly to building an application that allows an autonomous agent (or a human driver!) to navigate its environment.  And as usual we have our different video series to help tie the content back to its importance in the real world and to provide tiered levels of support to meet your personal needs.","Introduction to the CourseWelcome to the first week in the third course of our Intermediate Java Programming Specialization.  Once again start with introductions, and in particular introduce the unique structure of this course.  Also, if you're not sure if this course is right for you, we've got an optional pre-course quiz coming right up that can help you figure out if you're in the right place.  If you decide to stay with us (and we really hope you will!) we've got a great backbone project for you: your very own mapping application, inspired by Google Maps!  The core data structure throughout this course is graphs, which may very well be the most fundamental data structure in all of computer science.  Ready to begin?  So are we!Introduction to GraphsThis week we'll start getting technical, introducing you to the central data structure in the course: Graphs.  You'll learn the basics and then have a chance to dive in a little deeper into the code, getting ready to start building that Google Maps-like application.Class design and simple graph searchThis week you'll get the backbone of your map search engine up and running.  In previous courses, including the previous courses in this specialization, you've probably been given most of the classes you needed to complete the assignments.  But learning how to design classes from scratch is a key skill that you will need as you become a more sophisticated Java programmer.  This week we'll give you the tools you need to create a robust and elegant class design for your map search engine.  We'll introduce a similar problem and show you how it can be represented as a graph.  Then we'll introduce two core search algorithms: depth-first search and breadth-first search.  Finally, we'll turn our graph problem into a set of Java classes.   Your task on the programming assignment this week will be to do the same thing, but in the context on the map search engine!Finding shortest paths in weighted graphsIn the past two weeks, you've developed a strong understanding of how to design classes to represent a graph and how to use a graph to represent a map.  In this week, you'll add a key feature of map data to our graph representation -- distances -- by adding weights to your edges to produce a ""weighted graph"".  Although this might seem like a small change, the algorithms that work for unweighted graphs may prove ineffective for weighted graphs.  To address this problem, you'll explore more advanced shortest path algorithms.  First, you'll see how to find the shortest path on a weighted graph, then you'll see how to find it more quickly.  In the project, you'll apply these ideas to create the core of any good mapping application: finding the shortest route from one location to another.Route planning and NP-hard graph problemsIn this week, we'll go beyond the problem of finding a path between two points, and focus on problems requiring overall path planning.  For example, if you wanted to go on errands and visit 6 different locations before returning home, what is the optimal route? This problem is actually a really well known problem in computer science known as the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP).  Attempting to solve the problem will lead us to explore complexity theory, what it means to be NP-Hard, and how to solve ""hard"" problems using heuristics and approximation algorithms.  We'll end the week by showing how reformulating a problem can have a huge impact: making something which was effectively unsolvable before, now solvable!  End of Course Project ExtensionYou made it to the last week of our course!  We're glad you're still with us.  As a reward, there's no new content to learn this week.  Instead you'll get the opportunity to extend your project in a direction of your own choosing.  We hope you've got some neat ideas for personalizing your map application, and we look forward to seeing them in the peer review gallery.

Its applications range from solving Sudoku puzzles to arranging seating in a wedding banquet.  The same technology can schedule planes and their crews, coordinate the production of steel, and organize the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Good decisions in manpower and material resources management also allow corporations to improve profit by millions of dollars.  Similar problems also underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, all of these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods.This course is intended for students who have completed Basic Modelling for Discrete Optimization. In this course you will learn much more about solving challenging discrete optimization problems by stating the problem in a state-of-the-art high level modeling language, and letting library constraint solving software do the rest.  This course will focus on debugging and improving models, encapsulating parts of models in predicates, and tackling advanced scheduling and packing problems. As you master this advanced technology, you will be able to tackle problems that were inconceivable to solve previously.Watch the course promotional video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc3cBvtrem0&t=8s","Debugging and Improving ModelsSimilar to computer programs, models can have bugs.  In this module, you will see the symptoms (unsatisfiability, too many solutions, too few solutions) of different bugs, and learn methods to discover what is going wrong with your model and how to fix it.  Equipped with these tools, you will be able to develop and debug complex models.PredicatesIn this module, you will learn how to encapsulate a complex constraint definition in a predicate definition to enable its reuse.  This will enable the construction of far more complex models with improved readability in a modular manner.  You will also encounter for the first time a problem with multiple objectives and learn how to compress them into one single objective.  In addition to this, you will learn how to model the banquet seating problem, which will assist you in many occasions in life.SchedulingLearn how to tackle complex project scheduling problems of various forms, progressively from ones with only basic precedence requirements to ones with unary resources and even cumulative resources. You will see how to model some of the complex constraints that arise in these applications.PackingIn this module, you will learn the important application of packing, from the packing of squares to rectilinear shapes with and without rotation.  Again, you will see how to model some of the complex constraints that arise in these applications.  Symmetry and DominanceThis final module looks at the various forms of symmetries that can appear in discrete optimization problems.  You will learn various methods and special constraints to break such symmetries so as to increase solving efficiency.  You will also learn the notion of dominance, which is a generalization of symmetries, and also dominance breaking techniques.",Free Online Course (Audit),Upcoming,English,"8th Apr, 2019",N/A,5 weeks long,"[""Jimmy Ho Man Lee"",""Prof. Peter James Stuckey""]"

The programming challenges represent an important (and often the most difficult!) part of this specialization because the only way to fully understand an algorithm is to implement it. Writing correct and efficient programs is hard; please don’t be surprised if they don’t work as you planned—our first programs did not work either! We will help you on your journey through the specialization by showing how to implement your first programming challenges. We will also introduce testing techniques that will help increase your chances of passing assignments on your first attempt. In case your program does not work as intended, we will show how to fix it, even if you don’t yet know which test your implementation is failing on.Module 2: IntroductionIn this module you will learn that programs based on efficient algorithms can solve the same problem billions of times faster than programs based on naïve algorithms. You will learn how to estimate the running time and memory of an algorithm without even implementing it. Armed with this knowledge, you will be able to compare various algorithms, select the most efficient ones, and finally implement them as our programming challenges!Module 3: Greedy AlgorithmsIn this module you will learn about seemingly naïve yet powerful class of algorithms called greedy algorithms. After you will learn the key idea behind the greedy algorithms, you may feel that they represent the algorithmic Swiss army knife that can be applied to solve nearly all programming challenges in this course. But be warned: with a few exceptions that we will cover, this intuitive idea rarely works in practice! For this reason, it is important to prove that a greedy algorithm always produces an optimal solution before using this algorithm. In the end of this module, we will test your intuition and taste for greedy algorithms by offering several programming challenges.Module 4: Divide-and-ConquerIn this module you will learn about a powerful algorithmic technique called Divide and Conquer. Based on this technique, you will see how to search huge databases millions of times faster than using naïve linear search. You will even learn that the standard way to multiply numbers (that you learned in the grade school) is far from the being the fastest! We will then apply the divide-and-conquer technique to design two efficient algorithms (merge sort and quick sort) for sorting huge lists, a problem that finds many applications in practice. Finally, we will show that these two algorithms are optimal, that is, no algorithm can sort faster!Modules 5 and 6: Dynamic ProgrammingIn this final module of the course you will learn about the powerful algorithmic technique for solving many optimization problems called Dynamic Programming. It turned out that dynamic programming can solve many problems that evade all attempts to solve them using greedy or divide-and-conquer strategy. There are countless applications of dynamic programming in practice: from maximizing the advertisement revenue of a TV station, to search for similar Internet pages, to gene finding (the problem where biologists need to find the minimum number of mutations to transform one gene into another).

Among other features, functional languages offer a compact notation for writing programs, powerful abstraction methods for structuring programs, and a simple mathematical basis that supports reasoning about programs.Functional languages represent the leading edge of programming language design, and the primary setting in which new programming concepts are introduced and studied. All contemporary programming languages such as Hack/PHP, C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Racket, … support higher-order programming via the concept of closures or lambda expressions.This course will use Haskell as the medium for understanding the basic principles of functional programming. While the specific language isn't all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients of programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell.Once you understand the Why, What and How that underlies pure functional programming and learned to “think like a fundamentalist”, we will apply the concepts of functional programming to “code like a hacker” in mainstream programming languages, using Facebook’s novel Hack language as our main example. This course assumes no prior knowledge of functional programming, but assumes you have at least one year of programming experience in a regular programming language such as Java, .NET, Javascript or PHP.LICENSEThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.",N/A,Free Online Course (Audit),Self Paced,English,Self paced,4-6 hours a week,4 weeks long,"[""Erik Meijer""]"

A game world is not just a backdrop for your game—be it minimal or detailed, contained or part of a much bigger universe, it provides the context for your player. Ultimately, a game world should feel alive and wholly unique to any player who will experience it. In this course, we will explore game worlds in existing games and study the art and influences that inform their themes and styles. We will also investigate key components of environment and level design as well as strategies designers use to define gameplay or advance it. We’ll also look at navigation and the elements that make your world as real (or unreal) as you want it to be. A weekly challenge will prompt you to explore styles and inspirations for possible game worlds, and you’ll learn effective ways to communicate your ideas from concepts to presentation-worthy proofs of concept.","Introduction to World Design During this first week, we'll start with a brief overview of game worlds and game design. We’ll also examine environments and larger world-based concepts to see how games incorporate a macro-level view of how they progress. At the end of the week, a short assignment prompts you to examine, analyze and comment on games that marked or interested you in terms of their environment design. Do Your ResearchWhere do you start when designing a world? Where should you begin to look for sparking that creative impulse? This week we will be exploring ideas and presentation techniques for a game’s environment and world design. I encourage you to draw inspiration from other art practices, artists, video games or even your everyday surroundings. The assignment at the end of the week challenges you to present a proposal for a possible world through concept artwork for peer evaluation. The Way You MoveHow do you move in a video game world? This week we’ll discuss fundamental components and concepts in world and level design. Naturally, these evolve as the gameplay progresses but there are specific strategies you can use to create the finer details in a game environment. At the end of the week, you are challenged to take the previous week’s visual research exercise and expand upon it, giving it shape and volume. A Whole WorldBring your game world to life. In this final week, we’ll be putting down what will eventually define the look, ambience and atmosphere of your world, learning specifically how to convey a mood for a unique and engaging game environment. Go back to your assignment from Week 2 to pull from your inspirations and models. Build on your volumetric model from Week 3 and add details.

You will discover the powerful mechanisms that are offered to build and manipulate complex data structures in a clean and efficient way. And you will see how functions play a central role, as first-class values that can be freely used in any place where an expression can appear.The OCaml programming language is a member of the ML language family pioneered by Robin Milner. An important feature of OCaml is that it reconciles the conciseness and flexibility of untyped programming languages (like Python, for example) with the safety of strongly typed programming languages (like Java, for example). The OCaml compiler performs in fact a type inference: types of identifiers do not have to be declared but are inferred by the compiler at the moment of definition of an identifier, and then used for assuring type correctness when using an identifier.We will start by using OCaml as a purely functional programming language. At the end of this MOOC we will see that OCaml is in fact a multi-paradigm language which allows you to combine the functional programming style with the imperative programming paradigm.","Week 0: Introduction and overviewWeek 1: Basic types, definitions and functionsWeek 2: Basic data structuresWeek 3: More advanced data structuresWeek 4: Higher order functionsWeek 5: Exceptions, input/output and imperative constructsWeek 6: Modules and data abstraction",Free Online Course,Finished,English,"17th Sep, 2018",2 hours a week,6 weeks long,"[""Ralf Treinen"","" Yann Régis-Gianas"",""Roberto Di Cosmo""]"
https://www.classcentral.com/course/udacity-web-accessibility-6531,Web Accessibility,Google,Udacity,Web Development,"""ui, html, dom""","In this course you’ll get hands-on experience making web applications accessible. You’ll understand when and why users need accessibility. Then you’ll dive into the ""how"": making a page work properly with screen readers, and managing input focus (e.g. the highlight you see when tabbing through a form.) You’ll understand what ""semantics"" and ""semantic markup"" mean for web pages and add ARIA markup to enable navigating the interface with a range of assistive devices. Finally, you’ll learn styling techniques that help users with partial vision navigate your pages easily and reliably.This course is also featured in our Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program.Why Take This Course?Not every user approaches their applications with the same abilities. Whether it’s age, vision concerns, limited hearing, a broken arm, or other limitations, everybody deserves access to their apps. This course dives into the why and how of making web applications accessible. As a bonus, accessible sites also tend to be more usable for everybody!","Lesson 1: OverviewIn this lesson you’ll learn why accessibility matters, and who it affects. You’ll also get a first look at the web accessibility guidelines (WAI – Web Accessibility Initiative), understand what ""POUR"" means for accessibility, and locate checklists to help make your own sites accessible.Lesson 2: FocusIn this lesson you’ll learn how to make a page usable for anyone navigating with the keyboard. This starts with an introduction to the concept of focus (the element on the page to which keyboard events will be targeted), how to make elements focusable and when, and the order in which focusable elements will be traversed when exploring the page with the keyboard. You’ll also learn how to manage focus in forms, in custom components, pop-ups, and off-screen content. Lesson 3: Semantics BasicsIn this lesson you’ll build on keyboard navigation to make a page work for people who are unable to use a standard user interface, including users who can't see the screen. This requires ensuring assistive technology (such as screen readers) has sufficient information to present an alternative UI. You’ll use a screen reader to try out ordinary form elements and add markup to make them work even better. You’ll understand the accessibility tree the browser constructs from the DOM. Finally, you’ll learn how to built-in HTML features to ensure the accessibility tree accurately reflects the visual UI. Lesson 4: Semantics ExtrasIn this lesson, you’ll dive deeper into the screen-reader experience to add hyper-fast navigation. You’ll learn how to arrange headings and label links so screen reader users can fly through your pages! You’ll also learn how to call out ""landmarks"" into your page to speed up navigation even more. (As a bonus, this ""semantic markup""  also makes your markup more readable!)Lesson 5: Semantics - ARIAIn this lesson, you’ll move beyond the native elements of HTML into building custom controls and interactions. Of course you want these to be accessible, and that’s where ARIA comes in – Accessible Rich Internet Applications. You’ll learn how to add attributes to your custom interactions to make them as accessible as native elements. You’ll also learn how to manage these attributes from Javascript as the user interacts with your page.Lesson 6: StyleIn this lesson, you’ll learn the third pillar of Accessibility (after Focus and Semantics): Styling. Your page’s styles need to support highlighting the focus, indicating ARIA states, being zoomed in or out, and viewed by people with limited color or contrast vision. You’ll learn how to audit your page with the Chrome Accessibility Tools and correct any styling issues that pop up, as well as designing with accessibility in mind.",Free Online Course,Self Paced,English,Self paced,N/A,2 weeks long,"[""Alice Boxhall"",""Michael Wales""]"

The Lord of the Rings trilogy—the novels, films, and video game—are our central example of how “remediation” transforms familiar stories as they move across media. The course is designed as a university-level English literature class—a multi-genre, multimedia tour of how literature, film, and games engage in the basic human activity of storytelling.  Our journey will enable us to learn something about narrative theory, introduce us to some key topics in media studies and cover some of the history and theory of video games.  It will also take us to some landmarks of romance literature, the neverending story that lies behind most fantasy games: J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring, a bit of Edmund Spenser’s Faerie Queene, and poems by Keats, Tennyson, Browning, and others.Drawing on centuries of romance narrative conventions, the twenty-first century gaming industry has become a creative and economic powerhouse.

As is appropriate for our last week, we spend much of our time examining how Tolkien takes leave of his readers at the end of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. The final stage of MMOs--when your character has maxed out and completed all the quests--has always presented challenges to game makers.

This course is for anyone with mathematical, scientific or engineering backgrounds who wishes to develop a grounding in scientific computing. Using a range of hands-on lessons, participants in the course will develop the basic skills to tackle modern computational modelling problems.In developing this course, the instructors are inspired by the philosophy of open-source software. One of the tenets of the course is that we can use the web to interact, connect our learning, teach each other by sharing our learning objects. Therefore, this course is especially for those who are eager to participate in distributed knowledge creation on the web. Join us in this adventure!PREREQUISITESThe connected courses and MOOC are aimed at first-year graduate students or advanced seniors, but assume only a background in vector calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. We won't assume more than a beginner's programming experience and will guide students to develop a foundation in numerical methods, and hands-on experience coding up solutions to differential equations.","The course will consist of six learning modules that are somewhat self-contained. Each one will be motivated by a problem that can be modeled by a differential equation (or system of DEs) and will build new concepts in numerical computing, new coding skills and ideas about analysis of numerical solutions.The learning modules are roughly as follows:The phugoid model of glider flight.Described by a set of two nonlinear ordinary differential equations, the phugoid model motivates numerical time integration methods, and we will build it starting from an even simpler model (e.g., simple harmonic motion), building up to the full nonlinear model in 4 or 5 lessons on initial-value problems. Roughly, this module would include: a) Forward/backward differencing and Euler's method for simple harmonic motion; b) extension to the phugoid model; c) the midpoint method, convergence testing, local vs. global error; d) Runge-Kutta methods.Space and Time—Introduction to finite-difference solutions of PDEsStarting with the simplest model represented by a partial differential equation (PDE)—the linear convection equation in one dimension—, this module builds the foundation of using finite differencing in PDEs. (The module is based on the “CFD Python” collection, steps 1 through 4.) It also motivates CFL condition, numerical diffusion, accuracy of finite-difference approximations via Taylor series, consistency and stability, and the physical idea of conservation laws.Riding the wave: convection problems.Starting with the inviscid Burgers’ equation in conservation form and a 1D shock wave, cover a sampling of finite-difference convection schemes of various types: upwind, Lax-Friedrichs, Lax-Wendroff, MacCormack, then MUSCL (discussing limiters). Traffic-flow equation with MUSCL (from HyperPython). Reinforce concepts of numerical diffusion and stability, in the context of solutions with shocks. It will motivate spectral analysis of schemes, dispersion errors, Gibbs phenomenon, conservative schemes.Spreading out: diffusion problemsStart with heat equation in 2D (first introduction of two-dimensional FD discretization). Introduce implicit methods: backward Euler, trapezoidal rule (Crank-Nicolson), backward-differentiation formula (BDF). Pattern formation models (reaction-diffusion). Theory content: A-stability (unconditional stability), L-stability. Fourier spectral methods and splitting.Relax and hold steady: elliptic problems.Laplace and Poisson equations (steps 9 and 10 of “CFD Python”), explained as systems relaxing under the influence of the boundary conditions and the Laplace operator; introducing the idea of pseudo-time and iterative methods. Linear solvers for PDEs : Jacobi’s method, slow convergence of low-frequency modes (matrix analysis of Jacobi), Jacobi as a smoother, Multigrid.Boundaries take over: the boundary element method (BEM)Weak and boundary integral formulation of elliptic partial differential equations; the free space Green's function. Boundary discretization: basis functions; collocation and Galerkin systems. The BEM stiffness matrix: dense versus sparse; matrix conditioning.

In addition, this course covers generating functions and real asymptotics and then introduces the symbolic method in the context of applications in the analysis of algorithms and basic structures such as permutations, trees, strings, words, and mappings.All the features of this course are available for free.  It does not offer a certificate upon completion.","Analysis of AlgorithmsWe begin by considering historical context and motivation for the scientific study of algorithm performance. Then we consider a classic example that illustrates the key ingredients of the process: the analysis of Quicksort. The lecture concludes with a discussion of some resources that you might find useful during this course.RecurrencesWe begin this lecture with an overview of recurrence relations, which provides us with a direct mathematical model for the analysis of algorithms. We finish by examining the fascinating oscillatory behavior of the divide-and-conquer recurrence corresponding to the mergesort algorithm and the general ""master theorem"" for related recurrences.Generating FunctionsSince the 17th century, scientists have been using generating functions to solve recurrences, so we continue with an overview of generating functions, emphasizing their utility in solving problems like counting the number of binary trees with N nodes.Asymptotics Exact answers are often cumbersome, so we next consider a scientific approach to developing approximate answers that, again, mathematicians and scientists have used for centuries.Analytic CombinatoricsAnalytic Combinatorics. With a basic knowledge of recurrences, generating functions, and asymptotics, you are ready to learn and appreciate the basic features of analytic combinatorics, a systematic approach that avoids much of the detail of the classical methods that we have been considering. We introduce unlabeled and labelled combinatorial classes and motivate our basic approach to studying them, with numerous examples.TreesThe quintessential recursive structure, trees of various sorts are ubiquitous in scientific enquiry, and they arise explicitly in countless computing applications. You can find broad coverage in the textbook, but the lecture focuses on the use of analytic combinatorics to enumerate various types of trees and study parameters.PermutationsThe study of sorting algorithms is the study of properties of permutations. We introduce analytic-combinatoric approaches to studying permutations in the context of this relationship.Strings and TriesFrom DNA sequences to web indices, strings (sequences of characters) are ubiquitous in modern computing applications, so we use analytic combinatorics to study their basic properties and then introduce the trie, an essential and fundamental structure not found in classical combinatorics.Words and MappingsWe view strings as sets of characters or as functions from [1..N] to [1..M] to study classical occupancy problems and their application to fundamental hashing algorithms. Functions from [1..N] to [1..N] are mappings, which have an interesting and intricate structure that we can study with analytic combinatorics.",Free Online Course (Audit),Upcoming,English,"25th Mar, 2019",6-8 hours a week,9 weeks long,"[""Robert Sedgewick""]"

https://www.classcentral.com/course/coursera-parallel-programming-in-java-8909,Parallel Programming in Java,Rice University,Coursera,Programming,,"This course teaches learners (industry professionals and students) the fundamental concepts of parallel programming in the context of Java 8. Parallel programming enables developers to use multicore computers to make their applications run faster by using multiple processors at the same time. By the end of this course, you will learn how to use popular parallel Java frameworks (such as ForkJoin, Stream, and Phaser) to write parallel programs for a wide range of multicore platforms including servers, desktops, or mobile devices, while also learning about their theoretical foundations including computation graphs, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism.Why take this course?•	All computers are multicore computers, so it is important for you to learn how to extend your knowledge of sequential Java programming to multicore parallelism.•	Java 7 and Java 8 have introduced new frameworks for parallelism (ForkJoin, Stream) that have significantly changed the paradigms for parallel programming since the early days of Java.•	Each of the four modules in the course includes an assigned mini-project that will provide you with the necessary hands-on experience to use the concepts learned in the course on your own, after the course ends.•	During the course, you will have online access to the instructor and the mentors to get individualized answers to your questions posted on forums.The desired learning outcomes of this course are as follows:•	Theory of parallelism: computation graphs, work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism•	Task parallelism using Java’s ForkJoin framework•	Functional parallelism using Java’s Future and Stream frameworks•	Loop-level parallelism with extensions for barriers and iteration grouping (chunking)•	Dataflow parallelism using the Phaser framework and data-driven tasksMastery of these concepts will enable you to immediately apply them in the context of multicore Java programs, and will also provide the foundation for mastering other parallel programming systems that you may encounter in the future  (e.g., C++11, OpenMP, .Net Task Parallel Library).","Welcome to the Course!Welcome to Parallel Programming in Java! This course is designed as a three-part series and covers a theme or body of knowledge through various video lectures, demonstrations, and coding projects.Task ParallelismIn this module, we will learn the fundamentals of task parallelism. Tasks are the most basic unit of parallel programming. An increasing number of programming languages (including Java and C++) are moving from older thread-based approaches to more modern task-based approaches for parallel programming. We will learn about task creation, task termination, and the “computation graph” theoretical model for understanding various properties of task-parallel programs.  These properties include work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, and Amdahl’s Law. We will also learn popular Java APIs for task parallelism, most notably the Fork/Join framework.Functional ParallelismWelcome to Module 2!  In this module, we will learn about approaches to parallelism that have been inspired by functional programming.  Advocates of parallel functional programming have argued for decades that functional parallelism can eliminate many hard-to-detect bugs that can occur with imperative parallelism.  We will learn about futures, memoization, and streams, as well as data races, a notorious class of bugs that can be avoided with functional parallelism.  We will also learn Java APIs for functional parallelism, including the Fork/Join framework and the Stream API’s.Talking to Two Sigma: Using it in the FieldJoin Professor Vivek Sarkar as he talks with Two Sigma Managing Director, Jim Ward, and Software Engineers, Margaret Kelley and Jake Kornblau, at their downtown Houston, Texas office about the importance of parallel programming.Loop ParallelismWelcome to Module 3, and congratulations on reaching the midpoint of this course!  It is well known that many applications spend a majority of their execution time in loops, so there is a strong motivation to learn how loops can be sped up through the use of parallelism, which is the focus of this module.  We will start by learning how parallel counted-for loops can be conveniently expressed using forall and stream APIs in Java, and how these APIs can be used to parallelize a simple matrix multiplication program.  We will also learn about the barrier construct for parallel loops, and illustrate its use with a simple iterative averaging program example.  Finally, we will learn the importance of grouping/chunking parallel iterations to reduce overhead.Data flow Synchronization and PipeliningWelcome to the last module of the course!  In this module, we will wrap up our introduction to parallel programming by learning how data flow principles can be used to increase the amount of parallelism in a program.  We will learn how Java’s Phaser API can be used to implement “fuzzy” barriers, and also “point-to-point” synchronizations as an optimization of regular barriers by revisiting the iterative averaging example.  Finally, we will also learn how pipeline parallelism and data flow models can be expressed using Java APIs.

A hypervisor keeps these “child” operating systems separate from the parent operating system. Hyper-V uses the same professional-strength hypervisor found in Windows Server products. In corporate settings, administrators can use server-based virtualization tools to give users access to apps or entire desktop environments, which can be delivered to a wide range of device types. Windows desktops and apps from the datacenter or RemoteApp from the Azure cloud can run on a variety of devices. Employees install Microsoft Remote Desktop clients and run desktops and apps on their laptops, tablets or phones and stay productive on the go. Module 3: Configure Storage Configuring data storage requires knowledge of both old and new technology. You need to be familiar with traditional local storage using hard drives as well as cloud-based storage using services such as OneDrive for Business. You also need to consider distributed storage options such as using Distributed File System (DFS) to replicate data across WANs as well as using Storage Spaces for local data resiliency.

Developers and the software industry are used to applications becoming faster by merely exchanging the underlying hardware. However, since the beginning of the century it has become apparent that this approach no longer works.Moore's law about the ever-increasing number of transistors per chip is still valid, but power consumption, thermal management and memory latency issues are making make serial code acceleration increasingly harder. Instead, hardware vendors now use additional transistors for multiple processing elements (‘cores’) per processor chip and deeper memory hierarchies. Modern hardware has the capability to transform any desktop, server, or even mobile system into some kind of parallel computer. This makes parallel programming the new default for application development. The exploitation of any additional horsepower from hardware is now in the responsibility of the software.The openHPI online course “Parallel Programming Concepts” presents relevant theoretical and practical foundations for parallel programming.

But monetization should be built into the fabric of a game from the beginning, because a clearly defined and understood monetization strategy can have tremendous impact on design decisions made during the development process. This kind of forward-thinking approach is especially important in today’s highly competitive game market, and keeping monetization strategy front-of-mind throughout can be the difference between product success and failure. This course will teach you how to make your game stand out in a very crowded field, and encourage people to pay for game features that will define the ultimate success of your product.Currently, most game apps are free to play, and many users are looking for something simple and entertaining without the risk of making a purchase.

As with all updates, this update provides new features and security measures. Discover what’s new in the Anniversary edition.  Module 2: Configure shared resourcesUsers need access to resources, including but not limited to files, folders, network shares, and printers. Your job, at times at least, is to let those users access what they need, and nothing more. That’s how you keep resources secure. This module covers all aspects of this, from configuring shared resources to configuring file and folder (and printer) access, and configuring authentication and authorization for both workgroups and domains.  Module 3: Securing corporate dataEncryption protects data from unauthorized access when other security measures fail. Much of the time failure is the result of someone gaining physical access to a machine and having the knowledge and time to figure out how to access the data on it. There are many ways this type of breach can occur. However, with Encrypting File System (EFS), the public and private keys that are generated during encryption ensure that only the user that encrypted the file can decrypt it. Technically, encrypted data can only be decrypted if the user’s personal encryption certificate is available, which is generated using the private key. Another user can’t access this key, and neither can a person who tries to access data to copy or move it who does not have the proper credentials. In this module, we also look at BitLocker and how it helps protect computers that are lost or stolen from data theft or exposure, and offers more secure data deletion when computers are decommissioned. Data on a lost or stolen computer is vulnerable to unauthorized access, either by running a software attack tool against it, or by transferring the computer's hard disk to a different computer. BitLocker helps mitigate unauthorized data access on lost or stolen computers by combining two major data-protection procedures: encrypting the entire Windows operating system volume on the hard disk, and encrypting multiple fixed volumes",Free Online Course (Audit),Self Paced,English,Self paced,3-4 hours a week,3 weeks long,"[""Philip E.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/coursera-concurrent-programming-in-java-8910,Concurrent Programming in Java,Rice University,Coursera,Programming,,"This course teaches learners (industry professionals and students) the fundamental concepts of concurrent programming in the context of Java 8.   Concurrent programming enables developers to efficiently and correctly mediate the use of shared resources in parallel programs.  By the end of this course, you will learn how to use basic concurrency constructs in Java such as threads, locks, critical sections, atomic variables, isolation, actors, optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections, as well as their theoretical foundations (e.g., progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability).Why take this course?•	It is important for you to be aware of the theoretical foundations of concurrency to avoid common but subtle programming errors. •	Java 8 has modernized many of the concurrency constructs since the early days of threads and locks.•	During the course, you will have online access to the instructor and mentors to get individualized answers to your questions posted on the forums.•	Each of the four modules in the course includes an assigned mini-project that will provide you with the necessary hands-on experience to use the concepts learned in the course on your own, after the course ends.The desired learning outcomes of this course are as follows:•	Concurrency theory: progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability•	Use of threads and structured/unstructured locks in Java•	Atomic variables and isolation•	Optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections in Java (e.g., concurrent queues, concurrent  hashmaps)•	Actor model in JavaMastery of these concepts will enable you to immediately apply them in the context of concurrent Java programs, and will also help you master other concurrent programming system that you may encounter in the future  (e.g., POSIX threads, .NET threads).","Welcome to the Course!Welcome to Concurrent Programming in Java! This course is designed as a three-part series and covers a theme or body of knowledge through various video lectures, demonstrations, and coding projects.Threads and LocksIn this module, we will learn about threads and locks, which have served as primitive building blocks for concurrent programming for over five decades.  All computing platforms today include some form of support for threads and locks, and make them available for use by developers in a wide range of programming languages. We will learn how threads can be created, joined, and synchronized using structured (e.g., synchronized statements/methods) and unstructured (e.g., java.util.concurrent libraries) locks in Java.  We will also learn about new classes of bugs that can arise when concurrent programs need to access shared resources.  These bugs are referred to as violations of liveness/progress guarantees, and include deadlock, livelock, and starvation.  We will conclude this module by studying different solutions to the classical ""Dining Philosophers"" problem, and use these solutions to illustrate instances of deadlock, livelock and starvation.Critical Sections and IsolationIn this module, we will learn different approaches to coordinating accesses to shared resources without encountering the deadlock or livelock bugs studied earlier.  Critical/isolated sections are higher-level concurrent programming constructs (relative to locks) that simplify the implementation of mutual exclusion by guaranteeing the absence of deadlocks and livelocks.  Object-based isolation relaxes the constraints imposed by critical sections by allowing mutual exclusion to be specified on a per-object basis, as illustrated in the Spanning Tree example.  Java's atomic variables represent an important, but restricted, case of object-based isolation that is implemented efficiently on all hardware platforms.  Finally, we will learn how object-based isolation can be further relaxed with read/write access modes.Talking to Two Sigma: Using it in the FieldJoin Professor Vivek Sarkar as he talks with Software Engineer, Dr. Shams Imam, at their downtown Houston, Texas office about threads, locks, deadlocks, high-level and low-level constructs, and the importance of concurrent programming.ActorsIn this module, we will learn another high-level approach to concurrent programming called the ""Actor"" model.  A major difference between the Actor model and the Isolated Sections model is that there are no data races possible in the Actor model because it does not allow for any form of shared variables.  However, as in all concurrent programming models, higher-level forms of nondeterminism are still possible in the Actor model due to an inherent asynchrony in the order in which messages may be delivered.  We will study multiple examples of concurrency using the Actor model, including the classical Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers, as well as producer-consumer patterns with both unbounded and bounded buffers.Concurrent Data StructuresIn this module, we will study Concurrent Data Structures, which form an essential software layer in all multithreaded programming systems.  First, we will learn about Optimistic Concurrency, an important multithreaded pattern in which two threads can ""optimistically"" make progress on their assigned work without worrying about mutual conflicts, and only checking for conflicts before ""committing"" the results of their work.  We will then study the widely-used Concurrent Queue data structure.  Even though the APIs for using concurrent queues are very simple, their implementations using the Optimistic Concurrency model can be complex and error-prone.   To that end, we will also learn the formal notion of Linearizability to better understand correctness requirements for concurrent data structures.  We will then study Concurrent Hash Maps, another widely-used concurrent data structure.  Finally, we discuss a concurrent algorithm for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree of an undirected graph, an algorithm that relies on the use of Concurrent Data Structures under the covers.Continue Your Journey with the Specialization ""Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java""The next two videos will showcase the importance of learning about Parallel Programming and Distributed Programming in Java.

Participants have access to screencast lecture videos, are given quiz questions, assignments and exams, receive regular feedback on progress, and can participate in a discussion forum. Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. You will need a decent Internet connection for accessing course materials, but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone.The course covers four broad areas: (1) Finite automata and regular expressions, (2) Context-free grammars, (3) Turing machines and decidability, and (4) the theory of intractability, or NP-complete problems.Why Study Automata Theory?This subject is not just for those planning to enter the field of complexity theory, although it is a good place to start if that is your goal. Rather, the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly, they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than ""push this button.""The concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach — simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example.During the course, I'm going to prove a number of things. The purpose of these proofs is not to torture you or confuse you. Neither are the proofs there because I doubt you would believe me were I merely to state some well-known fact. Rather, understanding how these proofs, especially inductive proofs, work, lets you think more clearly about your own work. I do not advocate proofs that programs are correct, but whenever you attempt something a bit complex, it is good to have in mind the inductive proofs that would be needed to guarantee that what you are doing really works in all cases.","Week 1: Finite AutomataWeek 2: Regular Expressions and Properties of Regular LanguagesWeek 3: Context-Free Grammars and LanguagesWeek 4: Properties of Context-Free Languages, plus introduction to Turing MachinesWeek 5: Turing Machines and UndecidabilityWeek 6: Intractable Problems (NP-Completeness)",Free Online Course,Self Paced,English,Self paced,8-10 hours a week,6 weeks long,"[""Jeffrey Ullman""]"

We will illustrate how the discipline of Clinical Bioinformatics provides an important bridge between the cutting edge science and the delivery of genomic medicine in clinical practice. By understanding the role of a Clinical Bioinformatician it will become clear how integral they are to ensuring the beneficial opportunities of genomic medicine are fully realised in patient care.Discover the potential of Clinical BioinformaticsThis is an exciting time. We are now beginning to sequence whole genomes in the clinic, the most personal information we can have on a patient. We can start to see how genome variants might impact on health and we can direct really precise medicine to individual patients. This is not without its challenges. The genome is a huge amount of information. Identifying the causative variant (the part in the genome that can cause a change in health) is like looking for a needle in a haystack. But what does this phrase actually mean? This course will take you into the world of a Clinical Bioinformatician and show you what they do behind the scenes when finding that needle in the genomic data. It will also show you what happens next and the important contribution Clinical Bioinformatician’s make to the patient’s journey.Explore the methods of Clinical BioinformaticsClinical Bioinformatics involves tools and technologies which require a certain set of skills and expertise. Using next generation sequencing techniques and data analysis allows the bioinformatician to filter and classify the information from the human genome. The course will bring these methods and processes to life using case studies, interviews with bioinformaticians and a host of activities to help you understand the basics of Clinical Bioinformatics.Investigate the role of Clinical Bioinformatics in healthcareThe role of clinical bioinformatics can be seen as providing a link between computer science and biology and so involves tools and technologies which require specific skills and expertise. Using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques and data analysis bioinformaticians and clinical scientists can identify, filter and classify variants found in the human genome linked with genetic disease.  This course will bring these methods and processes to life using case studies, interviews with bioinformaticians and a host of activities to help you understand the role and its importance in genomic healthcare.

We will consider the fundamental design patterns and philosophies associated with modern web application architectures, along with their major components. By the end of this course, I expect you to be able to:Design, develop and deploy a modern web application. This course is not about how to build a pretty web page, it's about how to build and deploy the full stack of protocols and technologies associated with a complete web app. That said, it is not possible for you to become an expert in this area in a few weeks. My goal, rather, is to put you on the right path by providing a solid foundation and framework for understanding web applications, allowing you to dig deeper and learn more on your own. The next bullet points describe how we're going to do this.Understand the major architectural components in web apps, and how they fit together. Modern web apps are complex. A typical application has a database along with numerous scripts on one end of the web stack, a web server in the middle that delivers information over the Internet, and a user's browser on the other end of the web stack. Even getting started in trying to understand these components can be overwhelming. Consider just the programming languages involved in a typical web stack: from the database (SQL), to the web server (scripting language), to the browser (JavaScript, HTML, CSS), we're dealing with five different programming languages, not to mention the protocols they're operating over–and you need to know a little about them too! We'll introduce a number of software design patterns throughout the course that are aimed at helping you to manage this complexity.Use Ruby on Rails. We're going to learn about web apps through the Ruby on Rails framework.Rails is a framework for creating webapplications that is built on top of the Ruby programming language.I believe this is one of the best frameworksfor learning about web applications, and it's also proving highly successful asa platform for commercial offerings.That said, there are many other frameworks available, and the conceptsyou will learn using Rails are transferable to these other frameworks.Better understand modern software engineeringpractice.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-data-science-essentials-6512,Process Mining: Data science in Action,Eindhoven University of Technology,Coursera,Data Mining,,"Process mining is the missing link between model-based process analysis and data-oriented analysis techniques. Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains.Data science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as ""data science in action"".The course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.This course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.The course covers the three main types of process mining.1. The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.2. The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.3. The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.Process mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between ""business"" and ""IT"". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.The course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.After taking this course you should:- have a good understanding of Business Process Intelligence techniques (in particular process mining),- understand the role of Big Data in today’s society,- be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation, business intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and verification,- be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log (both manually and using tools),- be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models (both manually and using tools),- be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log (e.g., show bottlenecks),- have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project,- be able to characterize the questions that can be answered based on such event data,- explain how process mining can also be used for operational support (prediction and recommendation), and- be able to conduct process mining projects in a structured manner.","Introduction and Data MiningThis first module contains general course information (syllabus, grading information) as well as the first lectures introducing data mining and process mining.Process Models and Process DiscoveryIn this module we introduce process models and the key feature of process mining: discovering process models from event data.Different Types of Process ModelsNow that you know the basics of process mining, it is time to dive a little bit deeper and show you other ways of discovering a process model from event data.Process Discovery Techniques and Conformance CheckingIn this module we conclude process discovery by discussing alternative approaches. We also introduce how to check the conformance of the event data and the process model.Enrichment of Process ModelsIn this module we focus on enriching process models. We can for instance add the data aspect to process models, show bottlenecks on the process model and analyse the social aspects of the process.Operational Support and ConclusionIn this final module we discuss how process mining can be applied on running processes. We also address how to get the (right) event data, process mining software, and how to get from data to results.",Free Online Course (Audit),In progress,English,"18th Mar, 2019",4-6 hours a week,6 weeks long,"[""Dr. Steve Elston"",""Cynthia Rudin""]"

Its contents are heavily influenced by the idea that data analysisshould help in enhancing and augmenting knowledge of the domain as representedby the concepts and statements of relation between them. According to thisview, two main pathways for data analysis are summarization, for developing andaugmenting concepts, and correlation, for enhancing and establishing relations.The term summarization embraces here both simple summaries like totals andmeans and more complex summaries: the principalcomponents of a set of features and cluster structures in a set of entities.Similarly, correlation covers both bivariate and multivariate relations betweeninput and target features including Bayes classifiers.The view of the data as a subject ofcomputational data analysis that is adhered to here has emerged quite recently.Typically, in sciences and in statistics, a problem comes first, and then theinvestigator turns to data that might be useful in advancing towards asolution. Yet nowadays the situation is reversed frequently, especially withthe advent of Big Data. Typical questions then are: Take a look at this dataset - what sense can be made out of it? – Is there any structure in the dataset? Can these features help in predicting those? This is more reminiscent to atraveler’s view of the world rather than that of a scientist. The scientistsits at his desk, gets reproducible signals from the universe and tries to accommodatethem into a great model of the universe.

Answer: CAD software tools.  Learn how to build thesA modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast:  billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called “intellectual property” or IP blocks).  How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer: a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design. Our focus in this first part of the course is on key Boolean logic representations that make it possible to synthesize, and to verify, the gate-level logic in these designs.  This is the first step of the design chain, as we move from logic to layout.    Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: Computational Boolean algebra, logic verification, and logic synthesis (2-level and multi-level).Recommended BackgroundProgramming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms).  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.  Exposure to basic VLSI at an undergraduate level is nice -- but it’s not necessary.  We will keep the course self-contained, but students with some VLSI will be able to skip some background material.e tools in this class.","OrientationIn this module you will become familiar with the course and our learning environment. The orientation will also help you obtain the technical skills required for the course.Computational Boolean AlgebraIn this module, we will introduce advanced Boolean algebra math concepts that make it possible to take a ""computational"" approach to Boolean algebra. Boolean Representation via BDDs and SATWeek 2 introduces two powerful and important representation techniques that allow us to do SERIOUS computational Boolean algebra, on industrial-scale designs.2-Level Logic Synthesis, and Multi-Level Logic Synthesis via the Algebraic ModelIn Week 3, we will move from ""representing"" things to ""synthesizing"" things. In this case, synthesis means ""optimization"", or maybe the word ""minimization"" is more familiar from hand work with Kmaps or Boolean algebra.Multilevel Factor Extract and Don't CaresYou now know that to factor a multi-level network to reduce its complexity, you must look at the kernels and co-kernels. You know how to ""get"" these for any node. But -- what do you do with a big network to actually FIND the right common divisors? This is called EXTRACTION. We then look at a new opportunity to optimize multi-level logic: Don't Cares. In simple designs, we usually regard Don't Cares as ""impossible inputs"" -- things that just do not happen, so we can choose the value the hardware creates to minimize the logic.Final ExamThere is no new content this week.

It is a ""literacy"" course designed to introduce you to the various core components that make the web such a powerful platform for art – art that is not only visual, but sonic, physical, interactive, and social. It will give you the basics (in terms of knowledge and code templates) to make things that run in browsers using:• Animation with graphics and sound,• Interaction with graphics and sound,Just as you don't need to be a mechanic to drive a car, you do not need to wait until you are an expert programmer before creating work for the web.There is a vast array of tools for making things for the web. Making things for the web is a process of constant learning and discovery – not one of knowing everything first and then making. It is also a process of ripping and mashing rather than writing everything from scratch. Getting comfortable with this process is the first step, and is the approach we take in this introductory course.By the end of this course, you will be making things with the real-world core components that give the web its potential for art, but you will have only just begun. More importantly, you will understand what you have to learn more about to accomplish your artistic objectives, be able to recognize things and be able to evaluate their value to you, and have a command of the terminology you need to search for and discuss your needs and interests with the huge community of people on the net with experience (and code chunks) to share.Why JavaScript and the Web?There are some excellent special-purpose coding platforms for artists out there such as Processing for interactive graphics, Chuck or supercollider for synthesis, graphical languages such as Max/MSP or PD for interactive sound and graphics. These platforms have extensive communities of people to share experience and code with. However, these special-purpose platforms are not standard web building and design tools.What they offer is a direct path to achieving a specific artistic objective, but it is at the expense of a more general applicability of language, tools, and skills that would allow you to interact with people in the web-based creative industries.  They do a great job at ""hiding"" things you may not want to worry about as an artist, but dealing with a bit of the scaffolding is necessary if the web is the space you have chosen to embark on for developing your work.This course will take you through the basics you need to develop artistic content for the web using standard web tools – JavaScript, html, and several fundamental libraries.  It will point you to exactly what concerns an artist most – making creative content. It will guide you and teach you what you can ignore for now in order to focus on artistic content, but will not prevent you from integrating with the vast world of the web and learning and using some of the scaffolding if and when you should need it later.Our basic approach to achieving this goal is to ""throw you in to the deep end"" with a set of code templates for meeting artistic goals – interactive graphical mobile applications using physical sensors, for example,  and explaining simple things you can do immediately to explore and  implement your own ideas.The advantages to JavaScript:• It is the language embedded in all browsers today.• It is general purpose, and makes no assumptions that limit your artistic objectives.• You can deploy all your work on the web for others to experience.• You only need to learn one language for writing both client and server code.• A *lot* of other people use it that you can share and communicate with.• It is a marketable skill.Thus, we are not restricting you to special-purpose tools that don't generalize well to the web – but that doesn't mean you will have to write a bunch of code not related to your artistic vision.  The ""template"" technique used in this course is a ""middle way"" that gets you up and going fast, but provides a path to future growth and connection to the real world.You will learn to recognize patterns of code that you need not know how to write. This will provide you with a basic understanding of how things work in the real world (let's call it literacy). This will help you find, recognize, and use chunks of code that others share, and it will allow you to focus on code directly relevant to artistic content.This will give you the foundations you need to go on learning on your own by exploring the unstructured wealth of material available out there on the web to pillage and modify for your own work.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-microsoft-professional-orientation-data-science-6405,Discrete Inference and Learning in Artificial Vision,École Centrale Paris,Coursera,Artificial Intelligence,,"Artificialvision applications, such as object detection in natural images and automaticsegmentation of medical acquisitions, rely on models that interpret the visualinformation provided to a computer. The model provides a compromise between thesupport given by the observations and the prior domain knowledge. This courseis concerned with the two computational problems that arise when using such modelsin practice.Inference(Energy Minimization):Given a visual observation (for example, an image or an MRI scan), weare interested in estimating its most likely interpretation (i.e. the location of allthe objects in the image, or the segments of the MRI scan) according to themodel. While the problem cannot be solved optimally, we will describe state of the art approximate algorithms that provide very accurate solutions inpractice. While the theoretical properties of the algorithms will be discussedbriefly, the main emphasis will be on their application.Learning(Parameter Estimation):Given a set of training samples consisting of inputs and their desiredoutputs, (for example, images and the location of the objects, or MRI scans andtheir segmentations) we would like to estimate a model that is suited to thetask at hand. We will show how the problem of learning a model can beformulated as empirical risk minimization. Furthermore, we will presentefficient algorithms for solving the corresponding optimization problem.","Lecture1: Introduction to artificial vision with discrete graphical models: In this lecture, the interdisciplinary nature ofcomputational vision is briefly introduced along with its potential use indifferent application domains. Subsequently, the concept of discrete modelingof artificial vision tasks is introduced from theoretical view point along withshort examples demonstrating the interest of such an approach in low, mid andhigh-level vision. Examples refer to blind image deconvolution, knowledge-basedimage segmentation, optical flow, graph matching, 2d-to-3d view-point invariantdetection and modeling and grammar-driven image based reconstruction.Lecture2: Reparameterization and dynamic programming: In this lecture, we provide a brief introduction toundirected graphical models. We also provide a formal definition of the problemof inference (specifically, energy minimization). We introduce the concept ofreparameterization, which forms the building block of all the inferencealgorithms discussed in the course. We describe a simple inference algorithmknown as dynamic programming, which consists of a series of reparameterization.We show how dynamic programming can be used to perform exact inference onchains. Lecture3: Maximum flow and minimum cut: In this lecture, we introduce the concept of functions on arcs of a directed graph. Wefocus on a special function known as the flow function. Associated with thisfunction is the combinatorial optimization problem of computing the maximumflow of a directed graph. We also introduce the concept of a cut in a directedgraph, and prove that the minimum cost cut is equivalent to the maximum flow.We describe a simple algorithm for solving the maximum flow, or equivalent theminimum cut, problem.Lecture4: Minimum cut based inference: In this lecture, we show how the problem of inference for undirectedgraphical models with two labels can be formulated as a minimum cut problem. Wecharacterize the energy function that can be minimized optimally using theminimum cut problem. We show examples using the image segmentation and texturesynthesis problems, which can be formulated using two labels. We consider themulti-label problem, and devise approximate algorithms for inference based onthe minimum cut algorithms. We show examples using the stereo reconstructionand the image denoising problems.Lecture5: Belief propagation: In this lecture we present the basic concepts ofmessage passing and belief propagation networks. The concept is initiallydemonstrated using chains, extended to the case of trees and then eventually toarbitrary graphs. The strengths and the limitations of such an optimizationframework are presented. The image completion and texture synthesis problemsare considered as examples to demonstrate the interest of such a family ofoptimization algorithms.Lecture6: Linear programing and duality: In this lecture, discrete inference is addressed through concepts comingfrom linear programming relaxations. In particular, we explain how agraph-optimization problem can be expressed as a linear programing one and thenhow one can take benefit of the duality theorem to develop efficientoptimization methods. The problem of optical flow and its deformableregistration variant in medical image analysis is considered as an example todemonstrate the interest of such optimization algorithms.Lecture7: Dual decomposition and higher order graphs: In this lecture, we introduce the dual decompositionframework for the optimization of low rank and higher order graphical models.First, we demonstrate the concept of the method using a simple toy example andthen we extend to the most general optimization problem case. Three differentexamples are considered in the context of higher order optimization, theproblem of linear mapping between images, the case of dense deformable graphmatching and the development of pose invariant object segmentation methods inthe context of medical imaging.Lecture 8: Parameter learning: In this lecture, we introduce two frameworks for estimating the parametersof a graphical model using fully supervised training data. The first frameworkmaximizes the likelihood of the training data while regularizing theparameters. The second framework minimizes the empirical risk, as measured by auser-defined loss function, while regularizing the parameters.

Whatever the discipline or discourse it is important to be able to distinguish correct reasoning from incorrect reasoning. The consequences of incorrect reasoning can be minor, like getting lost on the way to a birthday party, or more significant, for example launching nuclear missiles at a flock of ducks, or permanently losing contact with a space craft.The fundamental question that we will address in this course is ""when does one statement necessarily follow from another"" --- or in the terminology of the course, ""when is one statement alogical consequenceof another"". This is an issue of some importance, since an answer to the question would allow us to examine an argument presented in a blog, for example, and to decide whether it really demonstrates the truth of the conclusion of the argument. Our own reasoning might also improve, since we would also be able to analyze our own arguments to see whether they really do demonstrate their conclusions.In this course you will be introduced to the concepts and techniques used in logic. We will start right from the beginning, assuming no prior exposure to this or similar material, and progress through discussions of the proof and model theories of propositional and first-order logic.We will proceed by giving a theory of truth, and of logical consequence, based on a formal language called FOL (the language of First-Order Logic). We adopt a formal language for making statements, since natural languages (like English, for example) are far too vague and ambiguous for us to analyze sufficiently. Armed with the formal language, we will be able to model the notions of truth, proof and consequence, among others.While logic is technical in nature, the key concepts in the course will be developed by considering natural English statements, and we will focus the relationships between such statements and their FOL counterparts.

A MapReduce program is defined via user-specified map and reduce functions, and we will learn how to write such programs in the Apache Hadoop and Spark projects.  TheMapReduce paradigm can be used to express a wide range of parallel algorithms.  One example that we will study is computation of the TermFrequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) statistic used in document mining; this algorithm uses a fixed (non-iterative) number of map and reduce operations.  Another MapReduce example that we will study is parallelization of the PageRank algorithm.  This algorithm is an example of iterative MapReduce computations, and is also the focus of the mini-project associated with this module.CLIENT-SERVER PROGRAMMINGIn this module, we will learn about client-server programming, and how distributed Java applications can communicate with each other using sockets.  Since communication via sockets occurs at the level of bytes, we will learn how to serialize objects into bytes in the sender process and to deserialize bytes into objects in the receiver process. Sockets and serialization provide the necessary background for theFile Server mini-project associated with this module.  We will also learn about Remote Method Invocation (RMI), which extends the notion of method invocation in a sequential program to a distributed programming setting.  Likewise, we will learn about multicast sockets,which generalize the standard socket interface to enable a sender to send the same message to a specified set of receivers; this capability can be very useful for a number of applications, including news feeds,video conferencing, and multi-player games.  Finally, we will learn about distributed publish-subscribe applications, and how they can be implemented using the Apache Kafka framework.Talking to Two Sigma: Using it in the FieldJoin Professor Vivek Sarkar as he talks with Two Sigma Managing Director, Jim Ward, and Senior Vice President, Dr. Eric Allen at their downtown Houston, Texas office about the importance of distributed programming.MESSAGE PASSINGIn this module, we will learn how to write distributed applications in the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) model, specifically by using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library.  MPI processes can send and receive messages using primitives for point-to-point communication, which are different in structure and semantics from message-passing with sockets.  We will also learn about the message ordering and deadlock properties of MPI programs.  Non-blocking communications are an interesting extension of point-to-point communications, since they can be used to avoid delays due to blocking and to also avoid deadlock-related errors.  Finally, we will study collective communication, which can involve multiple processes in a manner that is more powerful than multicast and publish-subscribe operations.  The knowledge of MPI gained in this module will be put to practice in the mini-project associated with this module on implementing a distributed matrix multiplication program in MPI.COMBINING DISTRIBUTION AND MULTITHREADINGIn this module, we will study the roles of processes and threads as basic building blocks of parallel, concurrent, and distributed Java programs.  With this background, we will then learn how to implement multithreaded servers for increased responsiveness in distributed applications written using sockets, and apply this knowledge in the mini-project on implementing a parallel file server using both multithreading and sockets.  An analogous approach can also be used to combine MPI and multithreading, so as to improve the performance of distributed MPI applications.  Distributed actors serve as yet another example of combining distribution and multithreading.  A notable property of the actor model is that the same high-level constructs can be used to communicate among actors running in the same process and among actors in different processes; the difference between the two cases depends on the application configuration, rather the application code.  Finally, we will learn about the reactive programming model,and its suitability for implementing distributed service oriented architectures using asynchronous events.Continue Your Journey with the Specialization ""Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java""The next two videos will showcase the importance of learning about Parallel Programming and Concurrent Programming in Java.

It's this commitment to experimenting that's at the heart of a high-functioning practice  of agile. This course shows you how to integrate the practice of experimentation across concept/feature testing, usability testing, and testing the software itself. Basically, you’ll learn how to answer these four big questions with experiments: 1. Should we build it? 2. Did it matter?3. Is it usable?4. Did it break?More specifically, after completing this course, you’ll be able to:   - Identify where and how to invest your team’s scarce time and energy into better testing for maximum impact on outcomes  - Coach your team on the relationship between idea, usability, and software testing to get the buy-in you need for strong     interdisciplinary collaboration  - Test ideas before you build them to avoid waste and help your team focus on what will really drive outcomes  - Test alternative interface patterns before you build them to maximize both product usability and purposeful     implementationAs a  Project Management Institute (PMI®) Registered Education Provider, the University of Virginia Darden School of Business has been approved by PMI to issue 20 professional development units (PDUs) for this course, which focuses on core competencies recognized by PMI.

The Batten Institute’s mission is to improve the world through entrepreneurship and innovation: www.batteninstitute.org.","Should we build it? Did it matter?Nothing will help a team deliver better outcomes like making sure they’re building something the user values. This might sound simple or obvious, but I think after this module it’s likely you’ll find opportunities to help improve your team’s focus by testing ideas more definitively before you invest in developing software. In this module you’ll learn how to make concept testing an integral part of your culture of experimentation. We’ll continue to apply the Lean Startup methods you learned in Course 2 ‘Running Product Design Sprints’ (and/or you can review the tutorials in the Resources section). We’ll look at how high-functioning teams design and run situation-appropriate experiments to test ideas, and how that works before the fact (when you’re testing an idea) and after the fact (when you’re testing the value of software you’ve released). Is it usable?The best products are tested for usability early and often, avoiding the destructive stress and uncertainty of a ‘big unveil’. In this module, you’ll learn how to diagnose, design and execute phase-appropriate user testing. The tools you’ll learn to use here (a test plan template, prototyping tool, and test session infrastructure) are accessible/teachable to anyone on your team. And that’s a very good thing- often products are released with poor usability because there ‘wasn’t enough time’ to test it. With these techniques, you’ll be able to test early and often, reinforcing your culture of experimentation.Does it break?You’ve learned how to test ideas and usability to reduce the amount of software your team needs to build and to focus its execution.Now you’re going to learn how high-functioning teams approach testing of the software itself. The practice of continuous delivery and the closely related Devops movement are changing the way we build and release software. It wasn’t that long ago where 2-3 releases a year was considered standard. Large firms like Facebook now release new code multiple times per day.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/nptel-programming-in-c-6704,Programming in C++,"Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur",NPTEL,Programming,,"There has been a continual debate on which programming language/s to learn, to use. As the latest TIOBE Index for April 2016 indicates – Java (21%), C (14%), C++ (6%), C#(4%), and Python (3%) together control nearly half the programming community. Given this, it is still important to learn C and C++ because of the efficiency they offer. While we appreciate that Java is good for applications, for graphics; and we acknowledge that Python is appropriate for portable software, engineering problem solving, and graphics; it is worth bearing in mind that the JVM and Python interpreter are indeed written in C++, making C++ the father of all languages today.Well, hence, C++ is the systems language. Why should I learn it if my primary focus is on applications? This is where the recent updates of C++, namely, C++11, C++14, and C++17 offer excellent depths and flexibility for C++ that no language can match. These extensions attempt to alleviate some of the long-standing shortcomings for C++ including porous resource management, error-prone pointer handling, expression semantics and better readability.The present course builds up on the knowledge of C programming and basic data structure (array, list, stack, queue etc.) to create a strong familiarity with C++98 and C++03. Besides the constructs, syntax and semantics of C++ (over C), we also focus on various idioms of C++ and attempt to go to depth with every C++ feature justifying and illustrating them with several examples and assignment problems. On the way, we illustrate various OOP concepts.While this course can be understood independently (after a course in C programming), it would help in developing understanding in OOP.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/coursera-computational-thinking-for-problem-solving-12278,Computational Thinking for Problem Solving,University of Pennsylvania,Coursera,Computer Science,,"Computational thinking is the process of approaching a problem in a systematic manner and creating and expressing a solution such that it can be carried out by a computer.  But you don't need to be a computer scientist to think like a computer scientist!  In fact, we encourage students from any field of study to take this course.  Many quantitative and data-centric problems can be solved using computational thinking and an understanding of computational thinking will give you a foundation for solving problems that have real-world, social impact.   In this course, you will learn about the pillars of computational thinking, how computer scientists develop and analyze algorithms, and how solutions can be realized on a computer using the Python programming language.  By the end of the course, you will be able to develop an algorithm and express it to the computer by writing a simple Python program. This course will introduce you to people from diverse professions who use computational thinking to solve problems. You will engage with a unique community of analytical thinkers and be encouraged to consider how you can make a positive social impact through computational thinking.","WEEK 1Pillars of Computational ThinkingComputational thinking is an approach to solving problems using concepts and ideas from computer science, and expressing solutions to those problems so that they can be run on a computer. As computing becomes more and more prevalent in all aspects of modern society -- not just in software development and engineering, but in business, the humanities, and even everyday life -- understanding how to use computational thinking to solve real-world problems is a key skill in the 21st century. Computational thinking is built on four pillars: decomposition, pattern recognition, data representation and abstraction, and algorithms. This module introduces you to the four pillars of computational thinking and shows how they can be applied as part of the problem solving process.WEEK 2Expressing and Analyzing AlgorithmsWhen we use computational thinking to solve a problem, what we’re really doing is developing an algorithm: a step-by-step series of instructions. Whether it’s a small task like scheduling meetings, or a large task like mapping the planet, the ability to develop and describe algorithms is crucial to the problem-solving process based on computational thinking. This module will introduce you to some common algorithms, as well as some general approaches to developing algorithms yourself. These approaches will be useful when you're looking not just for any answer to a problem, but the best answer. After completing this module, you will be able to evaluate an algorithm and analyze how its performance is affected by the size of the input so that you can choose the best algorithm for the problem you’re trying to solve.WEEK 3Fundamental Operations of a Modern ComputerComputational thinking is a problem-solving process in which the last step is expressing the solution so that it can be executed on a computer. However, before we are able to write a program to implement an algorithm, we must understand what the computer is capable of doing -- in particular, how it executes instructions and how it uses data. This module describes the inner workings of a modern computer and its fundamental operations. Then it introduces you to a way of expressing algorithms known as pseudocode, which will help you implement your solution using a programming language.WEEK 4Applied Computational Thinking Using PythonWriting a program is the last step of the computational thinking process. It’s the act of expressing an algorithm using a syntax that the computer can understand. This module introduces you to the Python programming language and its core features. Even if you have never written a program before -- or never even considered it -- after completing this module, you will be able to write simple Python programs that allow you to express your algorithms to a computer as part of a problem-solving process based on computational thinking.",Free Online Course (Audit),Upcoming,English,"1st Apr, 2019",6-8 hours a week,4 weeks long,"[""Susan Davidson"",""Chris Murphy""]"

https://www.classcentral.com/course/coursera-running-experiments-with-agile-5524,Running Experiments with Agile,University of Virginia,Coursera,DevOps,,"To deliver agile outcomes, you have to do more than implement an agile process; you have to create a culture of experimentation. It's this commitment to experimenting that's at the heart of today’s most successful implementations of agile. This course shows you how to integrate the practice of experimentation across concept testing, usability testing, functional testing, and continuous deployment. Basically, we’ll show you how to use experiments to answer these three big questions:      Should we build it? (And then: Did it matter?)     Is it usable?     Did it break?We'll show you how to: - Translate your product’s strategic direction into a user-centric charter with lots of small, testable ideas- Test user motivation to make sure you’re building something that matters- Design and conduct usability testing (even without working software)- Use narrative collaboration to focus your testing - Integrate functional testing into a more continuous release flowThis course is supported by the Batten Institute at UVA’s Darden School of Business. The Batten Institute’s mission is to improve the world through entrepreneurship and innovation: www.batteninstitute.org.","Should we build it? Did it matter?Ultimately, agile’s backbone is the substitution of observable results over the false certainty of elaborate plans. You’ve learned to avoid waste by validating problems/needs and user motivation before investing in software. Putting that testing into practice takes skill and the right kind of project charter--one that allows you to break the work into small(ish), testable ideas. In this module you’ll learn how to put that into practice by making concept testing an integral part of your culture of experimentation. You’ll go deeper on the Lean Startup techniques you’ve learned to test motivation. We’ll look at how to design and run situation-appropriate experiments, and how that works before the fact (when you’re testing an idea) and after the fact (when you’re testing the value of some working software)Is it usable?The best products are tested for usability early and often, avoiding the destructive stress and uncertainty of a ‘big unveil’. In this module, we’ll look at how to diagnose, design and execute phase-appropriate user testing as a standard practice. Anyone can learn to use the test plan template, prototyping tool, and supporting methods you’ll learn here. And that’s a very good thing! Very often products are released with poor usability because there ‘wasn’t enough time’ to test it. With these techniques, you’ll be able to test early and often, reinforcing your culture of experimentation.Does it break?The practice of continuous delivery and the closely related DevOps movement are changing the way we build and release software. It wasn’t that long ago where 2-3 releases a year was considered standard. Large firms like Facebook now release new code twice a day. How do they do it? In this module, we’ll look at the whole continuous delivery pipeline and step through what successful practitioners do at each stage and how you can diagnose and apply the practices that will improve your implementation of agile. Most of these practices build on concepts we’ve covered and we’ll pay special attention to those linkages.Your Continuous DeliveryYou've learned about the continuous delivery pipeline and how to improve cycle time.

This course teaches the basics of computer graphics that apply to all of these domains.  Students will learn to create computer-generated images of 3D scenes, including flybys of objects, make a real-time scene viewer, and create very realistic images with raytracing. We will start with a simple example of viewing a teapot from anywhere in space, understanding the basic mathematics of virtual camera placement. Next, you will learn how to use real-time graphics programming languages like OpenGL and GLSL to create your own scene viewer, enabling you to fly around and manipulate 3D scenes. Finally, we will teach you to create highly realistic images with reflections and shadows using raytracing.CSE167x teaches the foundations of computer graphics. This course runs for 6 weeks and consists of four segments. Each segment includes an individual programming assignment:Overview and Basic Math (Homework 0: 10% of grade)Transformations (Homework 1: 20% of grade)OpenGL and Lighting (Homework 2: 35% of grade)Raytracing (Homework 3: 35% of grade)This term, students who earn a total score of 50% or greater will have passed the course and may obtain a certificate from UC San DiegoX.FAQWhat is the format of the class?The class will consist of lecture videos, brief exercises, and homework assignments. Each of the four segments of the course will have 2-3 lectures. Each lecture includes 3-5 lecture videos, which last between 10 and 20 minutes. There will be a brief exercise after each lecture video to help you test your understanding of the material. Your score will be determined entirely by programming assignments for which you will receive immediate autograder feedback. You may submit your assignment to the autograder multiple times; only your last submission will count.Programming projects are to be implemented individually without copying code from other students, largely identical online resources, or previous instances of the class. However, short of posting or sharing actual explicit code, you are encouraged to collaborate and discuss problems in the discussion forums.Will the text of the lectures be available?Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.Do I need to watch the lectures live?No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. You can ""work ahead"" if you want to move faster than the due dates. Conversely, you can progress at a slower pace. Please note that certificates will only be awarded to students who obtain the requisite score by turning in assignments by the established deadlines.How much does it cost to take the course?Nothing: the course is free. If you expect to be doing a lot of graphics programming in the future, we would recommend the OpenGL and GLSL programming guides, but it is by no means required to purchase them. There are many free online resources for these topics, and we will be posting links to them.What computer system do I need for the course?The course material involves C++/OpenGL/GLSL programming that is portable. We provide skeleton code for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This is a modern course involving programmable shaders, but any machine built in the last few years should be adequate. We provide many compilation hints and tips, and Homework 0 is to ensure you can compile and work with the autograder. You do need some kind of C++ development environment; we provide several resources to get you started for Homework 0. In the highly unlikely event you cannot get your machine to work, you will hopefully have adequate time to find another system.Will I learn Maya/DirectX/3D Studio Max etc.?This is a course on the foundations of computer graphics and covers concepts, not the intricacies of a particular software package. That said, you will be able to write complex interactive and offline 3D graphics programs at the end of the course in C++, OpenGL and GLSL.Can I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants?Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster.I have a disability (visual/hearing etc.) Can I take the course?In most cases, yes. We provide transcripts for all lectures. Many leading computer graphics researchers have had visual impairments like color-blindness. However, this being a computer graphics course that relies on visual image comparisons, we probably cannot provide adequate support for those who are legally blind.I have a busy schedule this fall. Can I still take the course?The course does require about 12 hours per week of work, and the assignments (where you are given two weeks) require the time. Certificates of achievement require a passing score. Of course, you are welcome to just go through the lectures or attempt some of the assignments if you are not interested in a certificate; we hope to provide something for everyone.",N/A,Free Online Course (Audit),Self Paced,English,Self paced,6-12 hours a week,6 weeks long,"[""Ravi Ramamoorthi""]"

Follow a design creation process that includes specifications, algorithms, and testing.3.  Code, test, and debug a program in Python, based on your design.Important computer science concepts such as problem solving (computational thinking), problem decomposition, algorithms, abstraction, and software quality are emphasized throughout.

There is an optional certificate available for a fee.","Module 0: IntroductionIn Module 0, you will meet the instructional team and be introduced to the four themes of this course: computer science, problem solving, Python programming, and how to create video games.Module 1: Design Hacking Version 1In Module 1, you will explore the game creation process that is used in this course. You will use this process to design Version 1 of the first game, Hacking. You will use two problem-solving techniques: problem decomposition and algorithms. You will explore five criteria for problem decomposition: experiential decomposition, feature selection, problem refinement, spatial decomposition, and temporal decomposition. To create your design for Hacking Version 1, you will use three interactive learning objects: the description builder, functional test plan builder, and algorithm builder.Module 2: Program Hacking Version 1In Module 2, you will discover how lexics, syntax, and semantics can be used to understand and describe programming languages. You will use these concepts to understand your first Python statement (expression statement), first three Python expressions (literal, identifier, function call), and first five Python types (int, str, float, function, NoneType). You will use these Python constructs to write, test, and debug Hacking Version 1, a text-based game version. You will then reflect on your game version by using a third problem-solving technique called abstraction, including the specific technique of solution generalization, to solve similar problems.Module 3: Hacking Version 2In Module 3, you will identify solution issues in your game. You will apply a second form of the abstraction problem-solving technique, called using templates, to solve a solution issue by using a graphics library. You will then use lexics, syntax, and semantics to learn two new Python statements (assignment, import), two new Python expressions (binary expression, attribute reference), and one new Python type (module). You will employ these Python constructs and a simple graphics library to write, test, and debug Hacking Version 2.Module 4: Hacking Version 3In Module 4, you will modify your game design to support multiple gameplay paths using a new problem decomposition criteria called case-based decomposition, which utilizes a selection control structure. You will learn one new Python statement (if), one new Python expression (unary expression), and one new Python type (bool). You will employ these Python constructs to write, test, and debug Hacking Version 3.Module 5: Hacking Version 4 & 5In Module 5, you will modify your game design using two new abstraction techniques, called control abstraction and data abstraction. You will explore two different control abstractions, called definite and indefinite repetition. You will learn two new Python statements (for, while), four new Python expressions (subscription expression, expression list, parenthesized expression, list display), and three new Python types (tuple, list, range). You will employ these Python constructs to write, test, and debug Hacking Version 4 and Hacking Version 5. Module 6: Hacking Version 6In Module 6, you will learn a new control abstraction called a user-defined function. You will learn how to implement user-defined functions using two new Python statements (function definition, return). You will employ these Python constructs to significantly improve the quality of your code in Hacking Version 6.Module 7: Hacking Version 7In Module 7, you will not learn any new problem-solving techniques or Python language features. Instead you will exercise your problem-solving skills and practice the language constructs you already know to improve your proficiency. You will add some fun features to the Hacking game by designing, coding, testing, and debugging Hacking Version 7.Module 8: Poke the Dots Version 1 & 2In Module 8, you will design and implement Version 1 of a new graphical game called Poke the Dots. You will then modify your game design using data abstraction to create user-defined classes. You will learn two new Python statements (class definition, pass) that will allow you to construct your own Python types. You will employ these Python constructs to implement Poke the Dots Version 2.Module 9: Poke the Dots Version 3In Module 9, you will not learn any new problem-solving techniques or Python language features. Instead you will exercise your problem-solving skills and practice the language constructs you already know to improve your proficiency. You will add some fun features to the Poke the Dots game by designing, coding, testing, and debugging Poke the Dots Version 3.Module 10: Poke the Dots Version 4In Module 10, you will modify your game design using a new form of control abstraction called user-defined methods. User-defined methods allow you to restrict access to the attributes of a class to improve data abstraction. You will employ user-defined methods to implement Poke the Dots Version 4.Module 11: Poke the Dots Version 5In Module 11, you will not learn any new problem-solving techniques or Python language features.

Along the way you’ll also gain useful skills for which competitive programmers are so highly valued by employers: ability to write efficient, reliable, and compact code, manage your time well when it’s limited, apply basic algorithmic ideas to real problems, etc.We start from the very beginning by teaching you what competitions there are, what are their rules, what specifics problems have, how to read problem statements, how to organize your work, and what you should and shouldn’t do. So it’s fine if you’ve never taken part in programming competitions before.We’ll focus on skills essential to competitive programming: inventing solutions and proving their correctness, estimating their running time, testing and debugging programs, how to benefit from structuring code. We’ll also cover basic algorithmic ideas: brute force search, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, segment trees.On competitions, there are a lot of specific pitfalls, perilous to beginners — but that’s not to worry, as we’ll go through the most common of them: integer overflow and issues with fractional numbers, troubles of particular programming languages, how to get unstuck in general.And, you’ll hone all these skills by solving practice problems, which are just like problems on real competitions. You could use any of the following programming languages: C, C++, C#, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Python 2, Python 3, Ruby, Rust, Scala. We assume that you already know how to write simplest programs in one of these.","WEEK 1Programming CompetitionsWe'll begin with introduction to the world of competitive programming — the rules, specialties and helpful tips on taking part in competitions in general. In a separate lesson, we'll learn how to test programs: what kinds of test cases there are, how to organize the search for a bugtest, and particularly a method of automating testing called stress-testing.WEEK 2CORRECTNESS FIRSTIn this module, we'll start with the most basic things you need to actually solve algorithmic problems. First, we'll talk about structuring your code and intuition behind it — why it's very important, how to manage dependencies between parts of different purpose, how intuitive rules are enforced through formal invariants and conditions. We'll also identify a special class of solutions — brute force solutions — which are always correct, but often very slow. And we'll learn how to estimate running time of our solutions by using a powerful concept of big-O notation.WEEK 3COMMON STRUGGLESIn competitive programming, there are a lot of things to stumble upon — if you don't know them first! We'll delve into how numbers are represented in computers, identify the most common issues with integer and floating point arithmetic, and learn to overcome them. We'll also discuss how to get stuck less in general, especially when debugging solutions.WEEK 4COMMON STRUGGLES 2We continue considering common struggles arising in competitive programming. We start by learning how to prove that a natural greedy algorithm is correct. We also discuss programming languages: what features are most helpful on competitions, and what are the advantages and pitfalls of several frequently used languages. Finally, we study an essential and easy-to-implement data structure: the segment tree.WEEK 5Dynamic ProgrammingDynamic programming is a powerful algorithmic paradigm with lots of applications in areas like optimisation, scheduling, planning, bioinformatics, and others. For this reason, it is not surprising that it is the most popular type of problems in competitive programming. A common feature of such problems is that a solution is usually easy to implement. This does not however mean that it is also easy to find a solution! Therefore, it is important to practice solving such problems. And this is exactly what we are going to do in this module!WEEK 6Dynamic Programming 2We continue applying dynamic programming technique to various problems.",Free Online Course (Audit),Upcoming,English,"25th Mar, 2019",5-8 hours a week,6 weeks long,"[""Alexander S.

Learn Python programming language as a creative medium for design, architecture, art and beyond. Learners will develop, analyze and critique algorithmic approaches to digital drawing, modeling, and projection. Specifically, the powerful and robust Python Rhinoscript library will be introduced and explored in detail. This library allows Rhinoceros, the popular 3D graphics and computer-aided design (CAD) modeling software to be scripted with text-based code. Scripting in this manner can automate existing processes and can lead to novel kinds of relationships, and orders of shape and form.Architects, sculptors, and any artist or designer interested in either fabrication or communication of form and shape will recognize the importance of projection–the the transformation of three-dimensional geometry onto a two-dimensional picture plane, cut sheet, paper, or screen. As a result, this course focuses not only on the generation of geometry, but the output of geometry.In parallel to extending learners' technical proficiency, this course will touch on the conceptual and theoretical implications of algorithmic design. Each of the five lessons will build upon each other to develop an understanding of the Python language, algorithmic strategies, and digital geometric craft (the interrelated structures and topologies that make up digital models).","Session 1:Procedural PointsWhy design algorithmically? Students will understand the basics of Python syntax and organization of the Rhinoscript library. Students will be comfortable creating, running, and editing a basic script. Students will demonstrate a capacity to create, work with, and distinguish between point coordinates and point objects. Demonstrations: procedural point spiral, gradient point cloud.Session 2:Curves Vs. CurvatureWhat is the nature of a curve? Students will demonstrate multiple methods for creating and editing curves–which is the topological term for one-dimensional objects including straight line segments. The class will explore the concept of the “blip” and the capacity of a set of curves to collectively define space. Demonstrations: Interpolated curves of various degrees before and after sorting; best fit circles; curve parameters, evaluating curves, and extraction of curve points for the purse of editing curves with looping. Assignment: Double-blip connection of curves: blip within each curve and blip in the aggregation of curves.Session 3:The Depth Of A SurfaceWhat is the nature of a surface? Students will demonstrate methods for creating and editing surfaces beginning with the Rhinoscript functions that correspond with the most commonly used surface tools in Rhinoceros: loft, sweep1 and networksurface. Demonstrations: lofting and list-management, rebuilding surfaces in sequence. Assignment: conditional surface–divide a surface into patches and cull based on some geometric criteria.Session 4:Deconstruction Of Surfaces, The Genesis Of LinesHow can a surface generate lines? How can lines represent a surface? This week's lecture begins with an important premise: a surface is a 2-D space organized in terms of 'U' and 'V' axes that can be treated similarly to 'X' and 'Y' axes in Cartesian space. This allows drawing “in” a surface, trimming a surface based on U/V domains and the evaluation of surfaces based on 2-D parameters. Demonstration: Growing lines based on surface normals; surface to surface lines. Assignment: Hatch a terrain-like surface so that its geometry is revealed completely when viewed orthographically.Session 5:The Project Of ProjectionHow can projection serve as a creative act? Students will explore methods for geometrically constructing perspective computationally and use projective methods for the creation of new forms and shapes. Demonstration: constructing and arraying set of perspectives using surface-plane intersection. Assignment: Represent the process of oblique projection-as would be used to create an oblique axnometric drawing–using a set of curves.",Free Online Course,Self Paced,English,Self paced,N/A,N/A,"[""Carl Lostritto""]"

After the introduction we'll have a short warm up to get you comfortable with the code you will be building on to this class.  But don't worry--no graded programming assignments yet.  This week is all about getting comfortable and excited to learn.Working with StringsThis week we're going to dive into the course programming project.  In the first lesson you'll learn about Strings and Regular Expressions, and in the programming assignment this week you'll apply that knowledge to adding functionality to your text editor so that it can measure the ""readability"" of text by calculating something called the ""Flesch Readability Score"".  This course is focused on building code that not only does interesting things, but also finishes them quickly.  So, let's get started building some code!Efficiency Analysis and BenchmarkingWelcome to week 3!  The text-editor application you worked with last week does something, but it doesn't do it particularly fast.  This week we'll start talking about efficiency.  We'll introduce the concept of ""Big-O"" notation, which sounds a little silly, but is really a powerful (and extremely common) way of analyzing a program's efficiency, independent of the system that it's running on and the exact details of how it's implemented.  Then we'll go the other direction and dive into the details, talking about how to measure the actual running time of a piece of code to get an idea of how it really performs in practice. Interfaces, Linked Lists vs. Arrays, and CorrectnessThis week we'll start talking about some of the basic concepts that one expects to find in a data structures course: the idea of data abstraction, and a data structure called a Linked List.  Even though Linked Lists are not very efficient structures (for the most part), they do hit home the idea of ""linking"" pieces of data together in your computer's memory, rather than storing the data in one contiguous region.  This linking idea will be central to many of the more advanced data structures, namely trees and graphs, that are coming up later in this course and in the next course in this specialization.  In this module you'll also learn tools and procedures for unit testing your code, which is a way to make sure that what you've written is correct, and a staple practice of any sophisticated software developer.Trees! (including Binary Search Trees and Tries)Welcome to week 4!  We know you've been working hard.  We hope you tried that optional Markov Text Generation programming assignment last week, but if not, no worries.  You can always go back and do it later (spoiler alert: it's pretty amazing that such a simple algorithm can produce such realistic text).  This week there's more fun (and hard work) as we learn about trees.  Trees rely on the same linked structure idea as Linked Lists, only they're MUCH faster (usually...).  In the project this week you'll add auto-complete to your text editor.  Believe us when we say it's so cool when you get it working!  You'll see... and we bet you can't wait for the programming assignment now.  :)Hash Maps and Edit DistanceYou made it to the last week!  Congratulations on getting this far!  In this last week we'll be looking at a fundamental data structure called a Hash Table.  If you thought trees were fast, just wait until you see what Hash Tables can do!   Your last programming assignment will add spelling correction suggestions to your text editor, and there's an optional assignment that builds on the same ideas as the main assignment too, if you have the time and energy.",Free Online Course (Audit),In progress,English,"18th Mar, 2019",N/A,6 weeks long,"[""Christine Alvarado"","" Mia Minnes"",""Leo Porter""]"

The drinking water and electricity infrastructures are two of fourteen subsectors comprising what are known as ""lifeline infrastructure"". The 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan identifies four lifeline infrastructure sectors: 1) water, 2) energy, 3) transportation, and 4) communications. These sectors are designated ""lifeline"" because many other infrastructures depend upon them.  The drinking water subsector is part of the water sector, and the electricity subsector is part of the energy sector.  Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. The NIPP employs a five-step continuous improvement program called the Risk Management Framework. NIPP implementation is overseen by DHS-designated Sector-Specific Agencies staffed by various Federal departments. The Sector-Specific Agencies work in voluntary cooperation with industry representatives to apply the Risk Management Framework and document results in corresponding Sector-Specific Plans.  The program began in 2007 and the most recent Sector-Specific Plans were published in 2016. In February 2013, President Obama issued Executive 13636 directing the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a voluntary set of recommendations for strengthening infrastructure cybersecurity measures. EO13636 also asked Federal agencies with regulating authority to make a recommendation whether the NIST Cybersecurity Framework should be made mandatory. The Environmental Protection Agency who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the drinking water subsector recommended voluntary application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Department of Energy who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the electricity subsector replied that it was already implementing the Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, which indeed was what the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was based on.  The Department of Energy, though, recommended voluntary application of the ES-C2M2.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/coursera-homeland-security-cybersecurity-connection-it-s-not-about-the-terrorists-8820,Homeland Security & Cybersecurity Connection - It's Not About the Terrorists,University of Colorado System,Coursera,Cybersecurity,,"Welcome to Course 1 in CS4950, Homeland Security and Cybersecruity. In this course we examine the origins of homeland security and its connection with cybersecurity. Homeland security is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. Catastrophic destruction comes in two forms: natural and man-made. For most of history the man-made variety came in the form of warfare and required the combined resources of a nation state. All that changed March 20th, 1995. On that date, members of a quasi-religious cult in Japan attacked the Tokyo subway system using Sarin gas. It was the first deployment of a weapon of mass destruction my a non-state actor. The power of destruction once reserved to nation states was now available to small groups, even individuals. The incident was a wake up call for governments around the world. Defense establishments designed to keep rogue states in check were practically useless against non-state actors. Overnight, the number of potential enemies multiplied a hundred, maybe even a thousand-fold. In response to the Tokyo Subway Attacks, the United States took measures to protect itself from WMD attack by non-state actors. Those measures were still being enacted when the nation was attacked on 9/11. On September 11, 2001, nineteen hijackers inflicted as much damage as the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941. The investigating 9/11 Commission noted the attacks for their ""surpassing disproportion"". The hijackers had achieved WMD effects without using WMD. They did this by subverting the nation's transportation infrastructure, turning passenger jets into guided missiles. Again, the security implications were profound. Non-state actors seeking to inflict domestic catastrophic destruction did not need to import, fabricate, or acquire WMD as the nation was surrounded by the means of its own destruction in the form of critical infrastructure. The vulnerability of critical infrastructure had not gone unnoticed. Again, in response to the Tokyo Subway attacks, which themselves had been an attack on Japanese infrastructure, President Clinton in 1996 commissioned a panel to investigate the threat to United States' infrastructure. The panel replied in 1997 that there was no immediate threat to US infrastructure, but they were concerned with the growing risk of cyber attack. The same cyber physical systems that fueled the explosive growth of the Internet were being incorporated into Industrial Control Systems that underpinned much of the nation's critical infrastructure. The panel noted that the knowledge and skills necessary to mount a cyber attack on the nation's infrastructure was growing. As a result of this observation, President Clinton in 1998 ordered the protection of US critical infrastructure, especially from cyber attack. Following 9/11, critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity were designated core missions in the 2002 Homeland Security Act establishing the new Department of Homeland Security. They remain core missions to this day, but many don't see the connection. The connection is this: cybersecurity is essential to critical infrastructure protection, which is essential to homeland security, which is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction.  I look forward to working with you in the coming lessons.  Best wishes and good luck!Course 1: Homeland Security & Cybersecurity ConnectionCourse 2: Cybersecurity Policy for Water and Electricity InfrastructuresCourse 3: Cybersecurity Policy for Aviation and Internet InfrastructuresCourse 4: Homeland Security & Cybersecurity Future","Module 1: Domestic Catastrophic DestructionHomeland security is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. Domestic catastrophic destruction comes in two forms: natural and manmade. For most of history, the manmade variety came in the form of warfare and required the combined resources of a nation state. In this module we examine two pivotal incidents that changed that calculus, and demonstrated how destruction once reserved to the power of nation states was wrested by non-state actors.

The aviation and Internet infrastructures are also considered ""lifeline infrastructure"" as part of the transportation and communications sectors. Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. SSA responsibility for the aviation subsector is shared between the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation respectively.  The Department of Homeland Security retains sole responsibility as the Sector-Specific Agency for the Internet subsector.  While TSA and FAA have regulatory over the aviation subsector, DHS has no regulatory authority whatsoever over the Internet. In response to Executive Order 13636 issued by President Obama in February 2013, both sets of SSAs recommended continuing with voluntary cybersecurity measures. TSA and FAA reported they were working to implement the Transportation Roadmap across all transportation subsectors, including aviation. DHS reported that it was working with Internet providers to implement the Cyber Assessment Risk Management Approach. Despite some differences, the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA are very similar to the NIST Cybersecrity Framework and ES-C2M2 examined previously.  That is to say, they are predicated on a continuous improvement process that engages the whole organization in identifying and implementing incremental changes to enhance cybersecurity practices based on prevailing standards.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-data-structures-fundamentals-10246,Data Structures Fundamentals,"University of California, San Diego",edX,Algorithms and Data Structures,,"A good algorithm usually comes together with a set of good data structures that allow the algorithm to manipulate the data efficiently. In this course, part of the Algorithms and Data Structures MicroMasters program, we consider the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. You will learn how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments. This will help you to understand what is going on inside a particular built-in implementation of a data structure and what to expect from it. You will also learn typical use cases for these data structures.A few examples of questions that we are going to cover in this course are:What is a good strategy of resizing a dynamic array?How priority queues are implemented in C++, Java, and Python?How to implement a hash table so that the amortized running time of all operations is O(1) on average?What are good strategies to keep a binary tree balanced?We look forward to seeing you in this course! We know it will make you a better programmer.","Module 1: Basic Data Structures In this module, you will learn about the basic data structures used throughout the rest of this course. We start this module by looking in detail at the fundamental building blocks: arrays and linked lists. From there, we build up two important data structures: stacks and queues. Next, we look at trees: examples of how they’re used in Computer Science, how they’re implemented, and the various ways they can be traversed. Once you’ve completed this module, you will be able to implement any of these data structures, as well as have a solid understanding of the costs of the operations, as well as the tradeoffs involved in using each data structure.Module 2: Dynamic Arrays and Amortized Analysis In this module, we discuss Dynamic Arrays: a way of using arrays when it is unknown ahead-of-time how many elements will be needed. Here, we also discuss amortized analysis: a method of determining the amortized cost of an operation over a sequence of operations. Amortized analysis is very often used to analyse performance of algorithms when the straightforward analysis produces unsatisfactory results, but amortized analysis helps to show that the algorithm is actually efficient. It is used both for Dynamic Arrays analysis and will also be used in the end of this course to analyze Splay trees.Module 3: Priority Queues and Disjoint Set Union We start this module by considering priority queues which are used to efficiently schedule jobs, either in the context of a computer operating system or in real life, to sort huge files, which is the most important building block for any Big Data processing algorithm, and to efficiently compute shortest paths in graphs, which is a topic we will cover in our next course. For this reason, priority queues have built-in implementations in many programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python. We will see that these implementations are based on a beautiful idea of storing a complete binary tree in an array that allows to implement all priority queue methods in just few lines of code. We will then switch to disjoint sets data structure that is used, for example, in dynamic graph connectivity and image processing. We will see again how simple and natural ideas lead to an implementation that is both easy to code and very efficient. By completing this module, you will be able to implement both these data structures efficiently from scratch.Modules 4 and 5: Hash Tables In this module you will learn about very powerful and widely used technique called hashing. Its applications include implementation of programming languages, file systems, pattern search, distributed key-value storage and many more. You will learn how to implement data structures to store and modify sets of objects and mappings from one type of objects to another one. You will see that naive implementations either consume huge amount of memory or are slow, and then you will learn to implement hash tables that use linear memory and work in O(1) on average!Module 6: Binary Search Trees In this module we study binary search trees, which are a data structure for doing searches on dynamically changing ordered sets. You will learn about many of the difficulties in accomplishing this task and the ways in which we can overcome them. In order to do this you will need to learn the basic structure of binary search trees, how to insert and delete without destroying this structure, and how to ensure that the tree remains balanced.",Free Online Course (Audit),Self Paced,English,Self paced,8-10 hours a week,6 weeks long,"[""Daniel Kane "",""  Alexander S.

Thus, many engineering teams develop software that supports their native language first, postponing support for other languages until “later,” when they think they will have the bandwidth. In other words, they don’t plan ahead. The problem with this approach, which experienced developers have found out the hard way, is that it sacrifices budget, time, and opportunity.Redesigning and rebuilding a different edition of your software for each and every language or market can be a colossal effort. As this computer science course will demonstrate, planning ahead is far more efficient, and the marginal cost of supporting multiple languages from the get go is less than you may think. Harnessing international functionality in operating systems and programming languages makes writing code that works for multiple languages and markets much simpler than retrofitting existing code.The instructors for this course include programmers who have worked on globalization and localization of some of the world’s most successful software. They’ve experienced the good, the bad, and the ugly of creating world-ready software, and they’re here to ensure your software’s user experience works consistently, regardless of where users are from or what languages they speak.This course has three parts: the business case, world-ready design, and world-ready development.

It is also a fascinating subject in itself.Learners will become familiar with a broad range of mathematical objects like sets, functions, relations, graphs, that are omnipresent in computer science. Perhaps more importantly, they will reach a certain level of mathematical maturity - being able to  understand formal statements and their proofs; coming up with rigorous proofs themselves; and coming up with interesting results.This course attempts to be rigorous without being overly formal. This means, for every concept we introduce we will show at least one interesting and non-trivial result and give a full proof. However, we will do so without too much formal notation, employing examples and figures whenever possible.The main topics of this course are (1) sets, functions, relations, (2) enumerative combinatorics, (3) graph theory, (4) network flow and matchings. It does not cover modular arithmetic, algebra, and logic, since these topics have a slightly different flavor and because there are already several courses on Coursera specifically on these topics.","Introduction - Basic Objects in Discrete MathematicsThis module gives the learner a first impression of what discrete mathematics is about, and in which ways its ""flavor"" differs from other fields of mathematics. It introduces basic objects like sets, relations, functions, which form the foundation of discrete mathematics.Partial OrdersEven without knowing, the learner has seen some orderings in the past. Numbers are ordered by <=. Integers can be partially ordered by the ""divisible by"" relation. In genealogy, people are ordered by the ""A is an ancestor of B"" relation. This module formally introduces partial orders and proves some fundamental and non-trivial facts about them.Enumerative CombinatoricsA big part of discrete mathematics is about counting things. A classic example asks how many different words can be obtained by re-ordering the letters in the word Mississippi. Counting problems of this flavor abound in discrete mathematics discrete probability and also in the analysis of algorithms.The Binomial CoefficientThe binomial coefficient (n choose k) counts the number of ways to select k elements from a set of size n. It appears all the time in enumerative combinatorics. A good understanding of (n choose k) is also extremely helpful for analysis of algorithms.Asymptotics and the O-NotationIntroduction to Graph TheoryGraphs are arguably the most important object in discrete mathematics. A huge number of problems from computer science and combinatorics can be modelled in the language of graphs. This module introduces the basic notions of graph theory - graphs, cycles, paths, degree, isomorphism.Connectivity, Trees, CyclesWe continue with graph theory basics. In this module, we introduce trees, an important class of graphs, and several equivalent characterizations of trees. Finally, we present an efficient algorithm for detecting whether two trees are isomorphic.Eulerian and Hamiltonian CyclesStarting with the well-known ""Bridges of Königsberg"" riddle, we prove the well-known characterization of Eulerian graphs. We discuss Hamiltonian paths and give sufficient criteria for their existence with Dirac's and Ore's theorem.Spanning TreesWe discuss spanning trees of graphs. In particular we present Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph with edge costs. We prove Cayley's formula, stating that the complete graph on n vertices has n^(n-2) spanning trees.Maximum flow and minimum cutThis module is about flow networks and has a distinctively algorithmic flavor. We prove the maximum flow minimum cut duality theorem.Matchings in Bipartite GraphsWe prove Hall's Theorem and Kőnig's Theorem, two important results on matchings in bipartite graphs. With the machinery from flow networks, both have quite direct proofs. Finally, partial orderings have their comeback with Dilworth's Theorem, which has a surprising proof using Kőnig's Theorem.",Free Online Course (Audit),Upcoming,English,"25th Mar, 2019",N/A,11 weeks long,"[""Dominik Scheder""]"

It has been designed as part of a Coursera Specialization designed to help learners create complex, cloud-based Android Applications, and includes a final “capstone” project for those who earn Verified Certificates across all six courses.Note: We are proud to announce that the MoCCA specialization has already reached hundreds of thousands of learners around the globe. In its last iteration, we worked with Google to provide Nexus tablets, feedback from the Google App team, and the potential to be featured in the Google Play store to top course completers.This time around, we are providing more flexibility for all of you busy learners. We are running the Programming Mobile Applications courses in more digestible one-month-long sections, each with a meaningful mini-project at the end. Additionally, we will be re-offering the courses more frequently. For example, new sessions of my two introductory courses will be launched on a monthly basis, so that you can find a convenient time to join us or pick up where you left off if you didn’t quite finish before.For previous MoCCA students: If you have already earned a Verified Certificate in the previous version of this course, ""Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures: Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems” offered in May 2014, you do not need to retake this course to continue towards the Specialization certificate and final project in 2015. Please consult the Specializations Help Center or contact the Coursera support team if you are not sure whether you qualify.This MOOC and six others, taught by Dr. Adam Porter from the University of Maryland and Dr. Jules White from Vanderbilt University, have been designed to complement each other as part of the first trans-institution sequence of MOOCs taught on the Coursera platform, structured as follows:The first two MOOCs by Dr. Adam Porter, of the University of Maryland, are Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems Part 1 and Part 2. They focus on the design and programming of user-facing applications. The third, fourth. and fifth MOOCs by Dr. Douglas Schmidt, of Vanderbilt University, are Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems: Concurrency, Communication, and Content.They focus on middleware systems programming topics, such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, structured data management, local inter-process communication and networking, and integration with cloud-based services. The sixth and seventh MOOCs by Dr. Jules White, of Vanderbilt University, are Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems: Spring and Security. They focus on how to connect Android mobile devices to cloud computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2. The final “capstone” project will require students to develop a complex mobile cloud computing application from the ground up.Some of the programming assignments for these MOOCs will be coordinated.

Although there will be 10 weeks of lecture material, the required core of the course is six weeks long and can be completed flexibly within the ten week schedule to provide flexibility for students during the summer.An extended case study project will be used throughout the required core of the MOOC to showcase architectures for communicating with the cloud using HTTP, server-side processing of mobile data using servlets and the Java Spring Framework, and scalable storage of data using no-SQL databases and other platforms. Due to the importance of building secure and scalable mobile/cloud platforms, this MOOC will not only show you how to program handheld systems that talk to the cloud, but how to do so securely, scalably, and efficiently. Security and scalability topics will be woven into discussions of cloud service creation so that students learn, from the start, how to create robust cloud services for mobile devices.Four weeks of optional lecture material will also be provided for students who would like to gain a deeper understanding of the patterns and frameworks for building cloud infrastructure building.

Note: This course is part of a trans-institution sequence of MOOCs entitled Mobile Cloud Computing with AndroidThis MOOC and two others, taught by Dr. Adam Porter from the University of Maryland and Dr. Douglas C. Schmidt from Vanderbilt University, have been designed to complement one another as part of the first trans-institution Specialization taught on the Coursera platform. Some of the programming assignments and the course project for these MOOCs will be coordinated. Dr. Porter's MOOC, Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems, will be taught first; it focuses on the design and programming of user-facing application components. Dr. Schmidt's MOOC,Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems,will be taught next; it focuses on middleware systems programming topics, such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, structured data management, local inter-process communication and networking. This MOOC introduces the concepts and knowledge needed to connect the user-facing and service-based components, built in the first two courses, to the cloud.  If you just want to take some of the MOOCs in this sequence or take them all in different order you’re certainly welcome to do so, and you’ll still learn a lot. If you take all the MOOCs in this sequence in the order presented, however, you’ll gain a deeper, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud.","The course is organized into the sections outlined below.Section 1: Talking to the Cloud with HTTPModule 1: The HTTP ProtocolIntroductionWhat are Communication

She has experience working with Web analysis tools as well as marketing data. She wants to now expand into social media arena, trying to leverage the vast amounts of data available through various social media channels. Specifically, she wants to see how their clients, partners, and competitors view their products/services and talk about them. She hopes to build a new workflow of data analytics that incorporates traditional data processing using Web and marketing tools, as well as newer methods of using social media data.Sample Job Roles requiring these skills: - Social Media Analyst- Web Analyst- Data Analyst- Marketing and Public Relations Final Project Deliverable/ Artifact: The course will have a series of small assignments or mini-projects that involve data collection, analysis, and presentation involving various social media sources using the techniques learned in the class.","Introduction to Data AnalyticsIn this first unit of the course, several concepts related to social media data and data analytics are introduced. We start by first discussing two kinds of data - structured and unstructured. Then look at how structured data, the primary focus of this course, is analyzed and what one could gain by doing such analysis. Finally, we briefly cover some of the visualizations for exploring and presenting data.Make sure to go through the material for this unit in the sequence it's provided. First, watch the four short videos, then take the practice test, followed by the two quizzes. Finally, read the documents about installation and configuration of Python and R. This is very important - before proceeding to the next units, make sure you have installed necessary tools, and also learned how to install new packages/libraries for them. The course expects students to have programming experience in Python and R.Collecting and Extracting Social Media DataIn this unit we will see how to collect data from Twitter and YouTube. The unit will start with an introduction to Python programming. Then we will use a Python script, with a little editing, to extract data from Twitter. A similar exercise will then be done with YouTube. In both the cases, we will also see how to create developer accounts and what information to obtain to use the data collection APIs.Once again, make sure to go item-by-item in the order provided. Before beginning this unit, ensure that you have all the right tools (Python, R, Anaconda) ready and configured. The lessons depend on them and also your ability to install required packages.Data Analysis, Visualization, and ExplorationIn this unit, we will focus on analyzing and visualizing the data from various social media services. We will first use the data collected before from YouTube to do various statistics analyses such as correlation and regression. We will then introduce R - a platform for doing statistical analysis. Using R, then we will analyze a much larger dataset obtained from Yelp.Make sure you have covered the material in the previous units before proceeding with this. That means, having all the tools (Anaconda, Python, and R) as well as various packages installed. We will also need new packages this time, so make sure you know how to install them to your Python or R. If needed, please review some basic concepts in statistics - specifically, correlation and regression - before or during working on this unit.Case StudiesIn the final unit of this course, we will work on two case studies - both using Twitter and focusing on unstructured data (in this case, text). The first case study will involve doing sentiment analysis with Python. The second case study will take us through basic text mining application using R. We wrap up the unit with a conclusion of what we did in this course and where to go next for further learning and exploration.",Free Online Course (Audit),In progress,English,"18th Mar, 2019",N/A,4 weeks long,"[""Chirag Shah""]"

Problem solving in artificial intelligence (AI) is inspired from these diverse approaches. AI problem solvers may be based on search, on memory, or on knowledge representation and reasoning. An approach to problem solving is to pose problems as constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), and employ general methods to solve them. The task of a user then is only to pose a problem as a CSP, and then call an off-the-shelf solver. CSPs are amenable to combining search based methods with reasoning. In this 2 credit course we will look at general approaches to solving finite domain CSPs, and explore how search can be combined with constraint propagation to find solutions.This course is a companion to the course “Artificial Intelligence: Search Methods for Problem Solving” that was offered recently and “Artificial Intelligence: Knowledge Representation & Reasoning” that is being offered concurrently.

You will learn how system security level and tamper resistance level are defined and some general guidelines on how to make your system secure by design. In the second part, you will learn a useful mathematical operation called modular exponentiation. It is widely used in modern cryptography but it is very computational expensive. You will see how security vulnerability might be introduced during the implementation of this operation and thus make the mathematically sound cryptographic primitives breakable. This will also be important for you to learn side channel attack next week.Side Channel Attacks and CountermeasuresThis week, we focus on side channel attacks (SCA). We will study in-depth the following SCAs: cache attacks, power analysis, timing attacks, scan chain attacks. We will also learn the available countermeasures from software, hardware, and algorithm design.

By the end of this lesson switching between operating system will be easy and exciting for users of all skill levels.Rescuing your Bricked BoardNo one expects to damage their new DragonBoard™ 410c, but sometimes accidents happen. This module is dedicated to helping you not only prevent these accidents from happening, but also to fixing any problems should your board become damaged in any way. Here we will go over the difference between a soft brick and a hard brick and why they are two things you want to avoid.Creating your First ApplicationWelcome to Module 6! In this module we will be creating your first Android App to port to the DragonBoard™ 410c. This “Network Test” App will give you a teaser for the programmatic feats you will be able to accomplish with the DragonBoard™! You will learn about the different GPS and Location Services available on Android and how to access Bluetooth and Wi-fi Data. This module will briefly go over the importance of the Android Manifest and asking the Users for the proper permissions. Lastly, we’ll spice up our application by playing around with Intents and enabling the application to facilitate the above connectivity and network tests. This may sound like a lot, but don’t worry! We will help you get on your feet and by the end of this module, you’ll have coded a neat little application.Native Development Kit (NDK)In Module 7, will give you a general introduction and brief overview of Android Studio’s Native Development Kit (NDK). The NDK allows us users to program Android applications using C/C++. The NDK utilizes the Java Native Interface (JNI) to facilitate code and interaction between Java and C/C++. This tool was created for users who either have existing C/C++ libraries or plan to use libraries only available in C/C++. Android Studio has a specific build and compilation process catered specifically for NDK Applications that we will explain and cover in this Module. Once we have a better understanding of the NDK, we will create a straightforward “Hello World!” application.CALIT2 Bird ApplicationWho doesn’t love a good game to pass time? In this Module, we will create a more advanced and interactive Android Application / Game! We will be creating our version of FlappyBird--CalliBird or Calit2Bird, as we like to call it. We will cover the basics of the game by defining certain parameters. First, we have what we call our “Actors”. You can think of “Actors” as any part of the game that appears on the screen (the obstacles and the bird). In the game, we also define our own Location system and a Map class that will handle the different movements in the game. Next we define our game processor which is the backbone of the game. Game Processor ensures your score is constantly updated, delegates the movements to the Map class, and detects collisions, to name a few. Lastly, we will cover the importance of interfaces and its application to this Android App. Interfaces will enable us to 1. play CalliBird / Calit2Bird using any form of input we want (using touch, a sensor, a controller, etc.) and 2. render the game in any display we have (a screen, an led block, etc.). There is a lot of freedom with this game so you will be able to spice it up and make it your own!Monitoring your DragonBoard™ 410cCongratulations! You’ve made it to the last module of Course 2! In this Module we will cover a more advanced NDK Application. This application is a bit more challenging than prior applications because it is coded in both Java and C. Regardless of the rigour, we know you’ll be able to accomplish this feat! As for the application, we will be turning our DragonBoard™ 410c into a web server! This web server will detail information regarding the DragonBoard™ 410c’s connectivity, GPIOs, and any other statuses you may want to add. We will pull the information from the DragonBoard™ and encode it in a JSON format using Java, then use C to establish a server connection and send the data out. We will walk you through our code and thought processes so that you can gain a better understanding of how to use the NDK to run Android Applications as well as a taste of what the Internet of Things is all about.",Free Online Course (Audit),In progress,English,"18th Mar, 2019",N/A,10 weeks long,"[""Ganz Chockalingam"",""Harinath Garudadri""]"

https://www.classcentral.com/course/udacity-high-performance-computing-1028,High Performance Computing,Georgia Institute of Technology,Udacity,Algorithms and Data Structures,,"The goal of this course is to give you solid foundations for developing, analyzing, and implementing parallel and locality-efficient algorithms. This course focuses on theoretical underpinnings. To give a practical feeling for how algorithms map to and behave on real systems, we will supplement algorithmic theory with hands-on exercises on modern HPC systems, such as Cilk Plus or OpenMP on shared memory nodes, CUDA for graphics co-processors (GPUs), and MPI and PGAS models for distributed memory systems.This course is a graduate-level introduction to scalable parallel algorithms. ""Scale"" really refers to two things: efficient as the problem size grows, and efficient as the system size (measured in numbers of cores or compute nodes) grows. To really scale your algorithm in both of these senses, you need to be smart about reducing asymptotic complexity the way you’ve done for sequential algorithms since CS 101; but you also need to think about reducing communication and data movement. This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques you’ll need to do so.The techniques you’ll encounter covers the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and many core shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches).

Recall that a serial RAM assumes a sequential or serial processor connected to a main memory.Unit 1: The work-span or dynamic multithreading modelIn this model, the idea is that there are multiple processors connected to the main memory. Since they can all ""see"" the same memory, the processors can coordinate and communicate via reads and writes to that ""shared"" memory.Sub-topics include:** Intro to the basic algorithmic model** Intro to OpenMP, a practical programming model** Comparison-based sorting algorithms** Scans and linked list algorithms** Tree algorithms** Graph algorithms, e.g., breadth-first searchUnit 2: Distributed memory or network modelsIn this model, the idea is that there is not one serial RAM, but many serial RAMs connected by a network. In this model, each serial RAM’s memory is private to the other RAMs; consequently, the processors must coordinate and communicate by sending and receiving messages.Sub-topics include:** The basic algorithmic model** Intro to the Message Passing Interface, a practical programming model** Reasoning about the effects of network topology** Dense linear algebra** Sorting** Sparse graph algorithms** Graph partitioningUnit 3: Two-level memory or I/O modelsIn this model, we return to a serial RAM, but instead of having only a processor connected to a main memory, there is a smaller but faster scratchpad memory in between the two. The algorithmic question here is how to use the scratchpad effectively, in order to minimize costly data transfers from main memory.Sub-topics include:** Basic models** Efficiency metrics, including ""emerging"" metrics like energy and power** I/O-aware algorithms** Cache-oblivious algorithms",Free Online Course,N/A,English,Self paced,N/A,16 weeks long,"[""Rich Vuduc""]"

But with the explosion of the use of smartphones to access the Internet, the landscape of design has completely changed.  People viewing your site will now expect that it will perform regardless of the platform (smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer).  This ability to respond to any platform is called responsive design.This course will expand upon the basic knowledge of CSS3 to include topics such as wireframes, fluid design, media queries, and the use of existing styling paradigms such as Bootstrap.

How can you tell if your existing site is responsive?  This week we will begin with the theories behind the ""mobile-first paradigm"" -  the idea that your mobile site should provide everything needed, not a pared-down version of a good page.  We end the week by taking the first concrete step of using fluid measurements in your CSS.Week Two: Basic ConceptsThis week you will get a chance to put the theories into practice using media queries in your CSS.  These queries can automatically detect the size of the browser being used to view the page so that you can decide what type of look you want to achieve.  There will also be a discussion on common practices for designing your different views at various screen sizes (""viewports"").Week Three: Use Existing FrameworksAfter every good programmer has put in time creating sites from scratch, it is common to utilize existing tools out there.  After all, why recreate the wheel?  The work you have done up to this point will give you the knowledge needed to craft your own unique sites from these frameworks.

You will implement a login system for your blog and learn how to use hashing to securely read and transmit user passwords.Lesson 5: APIs (4.5 hours)Up until now, your programs have generated HTML that a browser can use to render a web page for the user. In the digital world, however, applications and websites communicate not only with people, but also with other applications and websites. By the end of this lesson, your blog will communicate with humans as well as with other computers. Your web application can generate data in formats such as XML and JSON that other computers can access through an API, or application programming interface. Those computers, in turn, can build websites or services that interact with your data. You’ll first learn how to use APIs, and then build web applications as services so that other computers can glean data from your application. We will look at both XML and JSON by investigating how to read them, how to interpret them, and how to manipulate them. Lesson 6: Caching (3.5 hours)In this lesson, we will explore how to prepare your applications to run at a large scale. So far, we've written 'toy' applications for just one or two users. If we want to start writing apps for thousands or, perhaps, even millions of users, then obviously we'll need to think about scaling. When we talk about scaling, this may mean running your application on multiple machines, storing huge amounts of data, or consuming large amounts of bandwidth. In particular, we will learn about caching, including the uses of caching, why you might want to cache, and specific caching implementations such as Memcached. Lesson 7: Scaling Up (2.5 hours)In this last lesson of the course, Steve has prepared a relaxing, story-time segment. You will hear web development anecdotes from people who have been through it all. You will enjoy interviews with engineer Neil Williams from Reddit, and engineer Chris Chew from Udacity. They will share their experiences on working with web applications, and you will see how all that you’ve learned in this course comes into the big picture.Final Project (8 hours)For the final project, you will build a fully functional wiki - a website that allows any page to be edited. The wiki you will be able to build by the end of the course will feature the following: Easily create new pages of the site by using the wiki edit capabilities. You should be able to enter a non-existent URL, redirect to an edit page, and create a new page from there. Have user accounts so that logged-in users only will have edit privileges.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/coursera-web-application-development-basic-concepts-5497,Web Application Development: Basic Concepts,University of New Mexico,Coursera,Web Development,,"This is the first course in a Coursera Specialization track involving Web Application Architectures.  This course will give you the basic background, terminology and fundamental concepts that you need to understand in order to build modern full stack web applications. A full stack web developer is familiar with each ""layer""  of the software technologies involved in a web application, including data modeling and database technologies, the web server environment and middleware components, network protocols, the user interface and basic visual design and user interaction concepts. In this course we will learn by doing.  We will start by learning the major components of web application architectures, along with the fundamental design patterns and philosophies that are used to organize them.  You will build and continually refine a fully functional full-stack web application as we progress through the modules in this course.  Along the way you will be exposed to agile software development practices, numerous tools that software engineers are expected to know how to use, and a modern web application development framework.This course is also available in Spanish. To join the Spanish version, visit this page: https://www.coursera.org/learn/apliweb.","WelcomeModule #1 - Web Applications in ContextThis module sets the context for what we will study in this specialization by first providing a historical perspective on computing and web applications.  Next we provide an overview of how the Internet works, and then we discuss how web applications have evolved over the past few decades. After that we’ll discuss some of the elements of modern software practice, including the typical tools that software engineers now use and the agile development practices they follow. The notion of software design patterns will introduced, and the n-tier architecture design pattern, fundamental to modern web application design, is then presented. Will also discuss a few current topics related to web application development. Finally, we will show you how to set up the software development environment you will use throughout the remainder of the courses in this. Module #2 - Web Applications FrameworksIn this module you will learn about web application frameworks. We will start by talking about the evolution of software and programming languages, and then talk about software application frameworks.  The fundamental trade-off we will consider is programmer productivity versus program efficiency.  Next you will learn about web application frameworks, as well as the model-view-controller design pattern that is the backbone for many of these frameworks.  We will also consider how these frameworks support the agile programming principles associated with modern software practice. This will include a discussion of distributed version control systems and you will learn how to use the popular Git system.  We will also demonstrate how to use Git with a Ruby on Rails application.  We will use Git to submit all of the programming applications in this specialization. Module #3 - Managing DataA successful web application provides information to users that is (1) useful, and also (2) easy to access and understand.  This information is often collected from users, as well as from other information sources, and must be stored in a manner that allows it to be manipulated by the web application. The typical approach is to store this data in a relational database.  In this module you will learn some basic concepts associated with modeling the data in a web application, including how to specify the relationships between various data entities.  We will also investigate how to hook a web application up to a back-end data store, along with good design techniques that will make it easier to use the data in your web applications by maintaining consistency throughout the entire web stack.  Module #4 - MiddlewareMiddleware is an abstraction layer that hides details about hardware devices and other lower-level software services from an application.  Middleware services implement common low-level functions, such as communication with the operating system, application servers, database servers, etc., so that application developers do not need to concern themselves with these details, and can instead focus on the application functionality they are trying to provide.  In a web application, these services generally make use of the HTTP protocol, and in a web application framework, the MVC design pattern can be thought of as being implemented over the middleware.Module #5 - The User InterfaceIn our final module we will discuss the User Interface. We will touch on CSS and JavaScript, and how these are used to add style to layout and design of HTML documents. We will also learn about Ajax and how it improves user requests.",Free Online Course (Audit),Upcoming,English,"8th Apr, 2019",N/A,5 weeks long,"[""Greg Heileman"",""Manel Martínez-Ramón""]"

Pointers provide control and flexibility when programming in C by giving you a way to refer to the location of other data. Arrays provide a way to bundle data by guaranteeing sequences of data are grouped together. Finally, recursive functions—functions that call themselves—provide an alternative to iteration that are very useful for implementing certain algorithms.","PointersPointers are one of the most important and powerful aspects of the C language.  Pointers are critical to understanding arrays, which let you manipulate sequences of data.  They also give a programmer control and flexibility when programming, enabling solutions that are clean and efficient. Some other languages use pointers implicitly—or pointer-like constructs—so understanding their use will make you a better programmer in any language.ArraysArrays are sequences of memory of the same type that are guaranteed to be one after another. This is an incredibly useful data format, enabling you to store many things together under one variable name. In this module, you will learn how to use arrays to solve more complex problems and lay the groundwork for more complex data types.Uses of PointersNow that you have mastered the basics of pointers and arrays, it is time to see some important uses of them.  In this module, you will learn about how to manipulate strings and multi-dimensional arrays.  You will also learn about function pointers, which allow you to pass ""which function to call"" as the parameter of another function.RecursionBy now you are familiar with iteration, in which repetition is expressed in terms of loops.  Another programming technique to accomplish similar ideas is ""recursion"" in which a more complex instance of a problem is expressed in terms of solutions to simpler instances of the problem.  In this module, you will learn how to read and write recursive code, giving you another powerful option for how to approach programming problems.ProjectNow that you have learned about pointers and arrays, you will build on the code you wrote in Course 2 to build a deck of cards and evaluate a poker hand.

We will describe these and provide a modern interpretation of these basic tools. Students will then become familiar with simple and still popular approaches. We will also include non-local means, a more modern technique that still uses classical tools.Image restorationThe goal of this unit is to complement Unit 3 by adding prior information about the sources of degradation. Students will learn that if we know about the degradation process, we can do better. The objective of this unit is to complete the training with basic and powerful classical tools.Image segmentation Not all parts of the image are the same, and students will learn the basic techniques to partition an image, from simple threshold to more advanced graph cuts and active contours. This is the first unit where student will learn about image analysis and image interpretation, and will learn why this is important, e.g., in medical imaging and object recognition.Geometric PDEs This is all optional material. It will help the students that are more mathematically oriented and want to better understand the math behind next unit's lectures. But you will be able to handle without it.The quiz is therefore practice only.This is the first “advanced” unit and smoothly follows from the previous one. Students will learn very modern tools, widely used today, and will contrast with units 3,4 to illustrate how significantly more advanced mathematical tools are also very useful in image and video analysis. We will connect some of these advanced tools with classical ones, e.g., average with heat flow and median with anisotropic diffusion. This will help to provide unified views to the students.Image and video inpaintingStudents will get involved with a very exciting topic, since image and video inpainting is one of the most used tools in the movie industry. They will learn the problem, and also how they can approach it from multiple directions. This will also help to illustrate how the same problem can be approached from multiple mathematical angles. We will connect this with Shanon’s work providing yet another angle. If you watched the lectures on PDEs you will have more mathematical background, but you will enjoy this unit and learn without it as well.Sparse modeling and compressed sensingHere the goal is to present one of the most modern tools in image and video processing, and students will learn something that is today at the top of active research. This will also help to illustrate the use of linear algebra and optimization in image and video processing. This is the last formal unit of the course.Medical imagingThis is a bonus unit. Enjoy it.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/openhpi-in-memory-data-management-465,In-Memory Data Management,N/A,openHPI,Computer Science,,"""In-Memory Data Management"" focuses on the management of enterprise data in column-oriented in-memory databases. Latest hardware and software trends led to the development of a new revolutionary database technology that enables flexible and lightning-fast analysis of massive amounts of enterprise data. The basic concepts and design principles of this technology are explained in detail. Beyond that, the implications of the underlying design principles for future enterprise applications and their development are discussed. The course will explain in detail the differences and advantages of an in-memory column-oriented database in contrast to traditional row-oriented disk-based storages. The following topics are covered (among others):Requirements for Modern Enterprise Computing, Enterprise Application CharacteristicsHardware Trends, Columnar Storage vs. Row StorageDictionary Encoding, CompressionScans, Selects, Deletes, Inserts, UpdatesIndices, JoinsApplications","Week 1: The first week will give you an understanding of origins of enterprise computing. It is vital to know the historic development which lead to the emergence of current hardware as we know it now in order to understand the decisions made in the past. Many characteristics of current applications, like materialized aggregates and a reduction of detail in the stored information, have their roots in the past. While these measures were helpful in former systems, they form an obstacle which has to be overcome now in order to allow for new, dynamic applications.Week 2: Within the second week, the differences between a horizontal, row oriented layout and a columnar layout are discussed. Concepts like compression and partitioning are introduced. Based on that, you will get an explanation of the internal steps performed inside the database to carry out the fundamental relational operations insert, update and delete. The week concludes with a fundamental difference of SanssouciDB to most other databases: the insert only approach. Following this concept, we circumvent several pitfalls concerning referential integrity and additionally gain the foundation for a gap-less time travel feature.Week 3: The content of week 3 focuses on more advanced structures and operations within the database. The differential buffer, a means to prevent frequent resorting of the dictionaries and rewriting of the attribute vectors, is explained in further detail. Subsequently, also the merge process, which incorporates the changes from the differential buffer into the main store, is illustrated. The retrieval of information via the select statement, as well as related concepts like tuple reconstruction, early and late materialization, or a closer examination of the achieved scan speed, are also part of this week's schedule. The description of the join operation, which is used to connect information from different tables, concludes this week.Week 4: Week 4 is all about aggregation. Aggregations are the centerpiece of every business analytics application. Given that huge impact of aggregates on all parts of a business, it is of great importance to understand what aggregate functions are, why we remove all materialized aggregates and go for aggregation on the fly. You will further learn how to greatly reduce the costs of this on demand approach by using the aggregate cache and understand its connection to the differential buffer and the merge process. In the units concluding this week, you will see new prototype applications using the aggregate cache to deliver complex simulations in real time.Week 5: Week 5 sheds light on some more inner mechanisms of the database. What happens in emergency situations, when for example the power is turned off? Logging and recovery are vital parts to know in order to understand why an in-memory database is as secure as a traditional disk based one. Further, the benefits of replicas are explained. We conclude the week with an outlook onto the implications that arise with the tremendously increased speed at hands.Week 6: Week 6 is centered on applications. The last conceptual unit is about data separation into active and passive. After that, we showcase several prototypes and sketch out potential fields to apply the technology, thereby also leaving the domain of pure enterprise solutions, by using main memory databases in weather simulations and medicine.Exam: The final exam will cover all content from the previous weeks and test your understanding of the course as a whole.",Free Online Course,Self Paced,English,Self paced,N/A,7 weeks long,"[""Hasso Plattner""]"

For example, a small number of specific changes in DNA sequence have been shown to lead to tumor development in mammals or the production of enzymes with altered properties.One of the jobs of a bioinformatician is to help determine where these changes are in a DNA sequence and sort out in that context what effects may result, which is usually done by aligning the sequences in question.In this course, part of the Bioinformatics MicroMasters program, you will learn about the theory and algorithms behind DNA alignments, practice doing alignments manually, and then perform more complicated alignments using web and software based approaches.This course is part of the Bioinformatics MicroMaster’s program from UMUC.

The algorithms will be analysed mathematically, so it is intended for a mathematically mature audience with prior knowledge of algorithm design and basic probability theory.Traditional algorithms work well when the input data fits entirely within memory. In many modern application contexts, however, the size of the input data is too large to fit within memory. In some cases, data is stored in large data centres or clouds and specific parts of it can be accessed via queries. In some other application contexts, very large volume of data may stream through a computer one item at a time. So the algorithm will get to see the data typically as a single pass, but will not be able to store the data for future reference.

Learning about dynamic memory allocation will allow your programs to perform complex tasks that will be applied in the final part of the specialization project: a Monte Carlo simulation for calculating poker hand probabilities.","Module 1: Interacting with the user and systemSo far, our programs have had a rather limited interaction with the user or rest of the system, printing some results to standard output (typically to the terminal). Now that we have learned about topics such as strings and arrays, we are ready to learn how to write a program that takes input from the user, takes arguments on the command line, accesses files, and does many other things we typically think of real programs as doing. Module 2: Dynamic allocationSo far, most of the memory we have used has been located on the stack. Dynamic memory allocation gives a programmer much more flexibility, in that it allows you to request a specific amount memory to be allocated on the heap, so that it will not disappear with the stack frame of the calling function.Module 3: Programming in the LargeSo far, we have focused exclusively on programming in the small—designing the algorithm for a small-sized task, implementing it, testing it, and debugging it. This module discusses three main differences that ""real"" programs exhibit. 1) They tend to be much larger than those we have written. 2) More than one person works on them, sometimes teams of hundreds to thousands. 3) Real software has a long life-span during which it must be maintained. Now that you have an understanding of the basics of programming in the small, we are ready to begin learning about programming in the large!Module 4: Poker ProjectIn this module, you will complete the Poker Project!

If you feel comfortable with your knowledge of tech terminology, feel free to skip these lessons since they will not affect the overall integrity of the course. If you see something that you want to know a little more about, feel free to watch the video to gain insight on some basic concepts. We do expect you to know the majority of this material before going into the next module, we would recommend going through the lessons as a quick brush up.VOIP in a NutshellThis module will take a high level look at what VoIP is in a nutshell. Essentially, we would like to talk a little more in depth about the key terms you may have seen in module 1. We will also go over a great open source VoIP application called Linphone, and explain a variety of ways you can use this open source code to expand on a VoIP application we will be making later on in the course. We will take a look at SIP and look at some online resources that might help you to understand the inner working of VoIP.CodecsIn this module our esteemed Professor Harinath Garudadri will talk about coders and decoders (Codecs). This will allow us to make better use of the communications in the data plane.We want to look at the motivation behind using Codecs, the different ways to take advantage of redundancies when using codecs and finally the ability to take advantage of different receiver / transmitter combinations. If we are able to understand the way that information is sent and received over the data plane we can create and use the right codecs.Make your own VoIP applicationThe main part of this module will focus on you making your very own VoIP application on the Android operating system. In order to do this, you might have to brush up on some of the materials in Course 2. You will be required to use Android Studio to push the application onto your board. You will need to know how to use Git, adb and possibly fastboot in order to accomplish this. We will provide you with the code for your application, but remember, the code we are giving you is only a template that can be used to build a bigger and better application with a wide variety of functions.

There was unprecedented investment in the development of new technologies during the war.  We start with Alan Turing and others at Bletchley Park.History: The First Internet - NSFNetIn the 1960s and 1970s, there was a great deal of research done to build the first wide-area packet switched networks for the US Department of Defense.  In the 1980s, the first “Internet” was formed to allow academic researchers to access supercomputer resources.History: The Web Makes it Easy to UseThe World-Wide-Web was invented in 1990 but it was not an overnight success.  But by 1994 - “the year of the web” - the web was being widely used and Internet usage was growing by leaps and bounds.History: Commercialization and GrowthThe late 1990’s saw the web and Internet used increasingly to revolutionize how business was done.  Companies like Amazon were founded and grew very rapidly.Technology: Internets and PacketsThe Internet is designed based on a four-layer model.  Each layer builds on the layers below it.

We will encounter a powerful algorithmic tool called dynamic programming that will help us determine the number of mutations that have separated the two genes/proteins.In the second half of the course, we will ""zoom out"" to compare entire genomes, where we see large scale mutations called genome rearrangements, seismic events that have heaved around large blocks of DNA over millions of years of evolution.  Looking at the human and mouse genomes, we will ask ourselves: just as earthquakes are much more likely to occur along fault lines, are there locations in our genome that are ""fragile"" and more susceptible to be broken as part of genome rearrangements?  We will see how combinatorial algorithms will help us answer this question.Finally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to solve problems in sequence alignment, including BLAST.","Week 1: Introduction to Sequence AlignmentWelcome to class!If you joined us in the previous course in this Specialization, then you became an expert at assembling genomes and sequencing antibiotics. The next natural question to ask is how to compare DNA and amino acid sequences. This question will motivate this week's discussion of sequence alignment, which is the first of two questions that we will ask in this class (the algorithmic methods used to answer them are shown in parentheses):How Do We Compare DNA Sequences? (Dynamic Programming)Are There Fragile Regions in the Human Genome? (Combinatorial Algorithms)As in previous courses, each of these two chapters is accompanied by a Bioinformatics Cartoon created by talented artist Randall Christopher and serving as a chapter header in the Specialization's bestselling print companion.

Answers to these questions, and many more, in this week's installment of the course.Week 2: From Finding a Longest Path to Aligning DNA StringsWelcome to Week 2 of the class!Last week, we saw how touring around Manhattan and making change in a Roman shop help us find a longest common subsequence of two DNA or protein strings.This week, we will study how to find a highest scoring alignment of two strings. We will see that regardless of the underlying assumptions that we make regarding how the strings should be aligned, we will be able to phrase our alignment problem as an instance of finding the longest path in a directed acyclic graph.Week 3: Advanced Topics in Sequence AlignmentWelcome to Week 3 of the class!Last week, we saw how a variety of different applications of sequence alignment can all be reduced to finding the longest path in a Manhattan-like graph.This week, we will conclude the current chapter by considering a few advanced topics in sequence alignment. For example, if we need to align long strings, our current algorithm will consume a huge amount of memory. Can we find a more memory-efficient approach? And what should we do when we move from aligning just two strings at a time to aligning many strings?Week 4: Genome Rearrangements and FragilityWelcome to Week 4 of the class!You now know how to compare two DNA (or protein) strings. But what if we wanted to compare entire genomes? When we ""zoom out"" to the genome level, we find that substitutions, insertions, and deletions don't tell the whole story of evolution: we need to model more dramatic evolutionary events known as genome rearrangements, which wrench apart chromosomes and put them back together in a new order. A natural question to ask is whether there are ""fragile regions"" hidden in your genome where chromosome breakage has occurred more often over millions of years. This week, we will begin addressing this question by asking how we can compute the number of rearrangements on the evolutionary path connecting two species.You can find this week's Bioinformatics Cartoon from Randall Christopher at the bottom of this E-mail. What do earthquakes and a stack of pancakes have to do with species evolution?

Third, you will learn how to write functions, which can be repeatedly called, in Python, and how to use them effectively in your own programs. Finally, you will learn how to control the execution process of your Python program by using conditional statements and looping constructs. At the conclusion of this module, you will be able to write Python scripts to perform basic data analytic tasks.Module 3: Introduction to Data AnalysisThis module introduces fundamental concepts in data analysis. First, you will read a report from the Association of Accountants and Financial Professionals in Business that explores Big Data in Accountancy. Next, you will learn about the Unix file system, which is the operating system used for most big data processing (as well as Linux and Mac OSX desktops and many mobile phones). Second, you will learn how to read and write data to a file from within a Python program. Finally, you will learn about the Pandas Python module that can simplify many challenging data analysis tasks, and includes the DataFrame, which programmatically mimics many of the features of a traditional spreadsheet.Module 4: Statistical Data AnalysisThis module introduces fundamental concepts in data analysis. First, you will read about how to perform many basic tasks in Excel by using the Pandas module in Python. Second, you will learn about the Numpy module, which provides support for fast numerical operations within Python. This module will focus on using Numpy with one-dimensional data (i.e., vectors or 1-D arrays), but a later module will explore using Numpy for higher-dimensional data. Third, you will learn about descriptive statistics, which can be used to characterize a data set by using a few specific measurements. Finally, you will learn about advanced functionality within the Pandas module including masking, grouping, stacking, and pivot tables.Module 5: Introduction to VisualizationThis module introduces visualization as an important tool for exploring and understanding data. First, the basic components of visualizations are introduced with an emphasis on how they can be used to convey information. Also, you will learn how to identify and avoid ways that a visualization can mislead or confuse a viewer. Next, you will learn more about conveying information to a user visually, including the use of form, color, and location. Third, you will learn how to actually create a simple visualization (basic line plot) in Python, which will introduce creating and displaying a visualization within a notebook, how to annotate a plot, and how to improve the visual aesthetics of a plot by using the Seaborn module. Finally, you will learn how to explore a one-dimensional data set by using rug plots, box plots, and histograms.Module 6: Introduction to ProbabilityIn this Module, you will learn the basics of probability, and how it relates to statistical data analysis. First, you will learn about the basic concepts of probability, including random variables, the calculation of simple probabilities, and several theoretical distributions that commonly occur in discussions of probability. Next, you will learn about conditional probability and Bayes theorem. Third, you will learn to calculate probabilities and to apply Bayes theorem directly by using Python. Finally, you will learn to work with both empirical and theoretical distributions in Python, and how to model an empirical data set by using a theoretical distribution.Module 7: Exploring Two-Dimensional DataThis modules extends what you have learned in previous modules to the visual and analytic exploration of two-dimensional data. First, you will learn how to make two-dimensional scatter plots in Python and how they can be used to graphically identify a correlation and outlier points. Second, you will learn how to work with two-dimensional data by using the Numpy module, including a discussion on analytically quantifying correlations in data. Third, you will read about statistical issues that can impact understanding multi-dimensional data, which will allow you to avoid them in the future. Finally, you will learn about ordinary linear regression and how this technique can be used to model the relationship between two variables.Module 8: Introduction to Density EstimationOften, as part of exploratory data analysis, a histogram is used to understand how data are distributed, and in fact this technique can be used to compute a probability mass function (or PMF) from a data set as was shown in an earlier module. However, the binning approach has issues, including a dependance on the number and width of the bins used to compute the histogram. One approach to overcome these issues is to fit a function to the binned data, which is known as parametric estimation. Alternatively, we can construct an approximation to the data by employing a non-parametric density estimation. The most commonly used non-parametric technique is kernel density estimation (or KDE). In this module, you will learn about density estimation and specifically how to employ KDE. One often overlooked aspect of density estimation is the model representation that is generated for the data, which can be used to emulate new data. This concept is demonstrated by applying density estimation to images of handwritten digits, and sampling from the resulting model.",Free Online Course (Audit),Upcoming,English,"25th Mar, 2019",N/A,8 weeks long,"[""Robert Brunner""]"

Maybe you have heard about web services being all the rage, but thought they were too complicated to integrate into your web application. Or maybe you wondered how deploying web applications to the cloud works, but there was too much to set up just to get going. In this course, we will explore how to build web applications with the Ruby on Rails web application framework, which is geared towards rapid prototyping.  Yes, that means building quickly! At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to build a meaningful web application and deploy it to the “cloud” using a Heroku PaaS (Platform as a Service).

You need the data for an application to be useful.” Great point! But what if… instead of getting the data from the database, we get it from the internet by tapping into one of the web services out there that readily provides data needed by our application? “Ok, but that’s probably very complicated”, you will say.

Perhaps, you have even taken Course 1, ""Ruby on Rails: An Introduction"" (we highly recommend it) where you relied on external web services to be your “data layer”. But in the back of your mind, you always knew that there would come a time when you would need to roll up your sleeves and learn SQL to be able to interact with your own relational database (RDBMS). But there is an easier way to get started with SQL using the Active Record Object/Relational (ORM) framework. In this course, we will be able to use the Ruby language and the Active Record ORM framework to automate interactions with the database to quickly build the application we want. In Rails with Active Record and Action Pack, we will explore how to interact with relational databases by using Active Record, a Ruby gem, which Rails uses by default for database access. We will then take a look at what role Active Record plays in the overall request-response cycle, when a client (the browser) requests data from the server, as well as how to submit the data to the server.  Of course, when accessing data, security is of paramount importance! We will talk about vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, as well as how to secure access to data by authenticating and authorizing users accessing the data. Take this course to build a Ruby on Rails application with Active Record to automate the detailed SQL interactions with our database.","Introduction to Active RecordIn this module, we will begin exploring the database-interaction portion of Rails. We will start off with migrations that enable you to create and modify the schema of the database. We will then move on to discussing the Active Record gem Rails uses, which enables you to create, retrieve, update, and delete the data from the database. Before looking at Active Record, we will talk about some advanced Ruby features of meta-programming that will help facilitate our Active Record journey.Deep Dive into Active RecordIn this module, we will continue exploring Active Record and look at ways to code advanced queries without exposing ourselves to risk from SQL injection (as well as what SQL injection actually is). We will then look at expressing relationships between entities in Active Record and validating the data being saved to the database.Introduction to Action PackIn this module, we will introduce Rails' Action Pack, which is a combination of Action Controller and Action View. We will see how REST has influenced routing in a Rails application and also talk about partials, form helpers, and layouts.Security and Nested Resources in Action PackIn this module, we will talk about how to deal with nested resources in Rails. We will then talk about securing your app with a username and password combination for authentication purposes and making sure that users are only authorized to make changes to and view their own resources.

Among R's strengths are that it's a succinct programming language and has an extensive repository of third party libraries for performing all kinds of analyses. Together, these two features make it possible for a data scientist to very quickly go from raw data to summaries, charts, and even full-blown reports. However, one deficiency with R is that traditionally it uses a lot of memory, both because it needs to load a copy of the data in its entirety as a data.frame object, and also because processing the data often involves making further copies (sometimes referred to as copy-on-modify). This is one of the reasons R has been more reluctantly received by industry compared to academia.The main component of Microsoft R Server (MRS) is the RevoScaleR package, which is an R library that offers a set of functionalities for processing large datasets without having to load them all at once in the memory. RevoScaleR offers a rich set of distributed statistical and machine learning algorithms, which get added to over time. Finally, RevoScaleR also offers a mechanism by which we can take code that we developed on our laptop and deploy it on a remote server such as SQL Server or Spark (where the infrastructure is very different under the hood), with minimal effort.In this course, we will show you how to use MRS to run an analysis on a large dataset and provide some examples of how to deploy it on a Spark cluster or a SQL Server database. Upon completion, you will know how to use R for big-data problems.Since RevoScaleR is an R package, we assume that the course participants are familiar with R. A solid understanding of R data structures (vectors, matrices, lists, data frames, environments) is required.Familiarity with 3rd party packages such as dplyr is also helpful.edX offers financial assistance for learners who want to earn Verified Certificates but who may not be able to pay the fee.

The sounds are captured by a sensor, such as a microphone or microphone array, and turned into a sequence of numbers representing the pressure change over time. The automatic speech recognition system converts this time-pressure signal into a time-frequency-energy signal. It has been trained on a curated set of labeled speech sounds, and labels the sounds it is presented with. These acoustic labels are combined with a model of word pronunciation and a model of word sequences, to create a textual representation of what was said.Instead of exploring one part of this process deeply, this course is designed to give an overview of the components of a modern ASR system.

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language developed specifically for scientific computing. This language will be particularly useful for applications in physics, chemistry, astronomy, engineering, data science, bioinformatics and many more. As open source software, you will always have it available throughout your working life. It can also be used from the command line, program files or a new type of interface known as a Jupyter notebook (which is freely available as a service from JuliaBox.com).Julia is designed to address the requirements of high-performance numerical and scientific computing while also being effective for general-purpose programming. You will be able to access all the available processors and memory, scrape data from anywhere on the web, and have it always accessible through any device you care to use as long as it has a browser.  Join us to discover new computing possibilities. Let's get started on learning Julia.By the end of the course you will be able to:- Programme using the Julia language by practising through assignments- Write your own simple Julia programs from scratch- Understand the advantages and capacities of Julia as a computing language- Work in Jupyter notebooks using the Julia language- Use various Julia packages such as  Plots, DataFrames and StatsThe course is delivered through video lectures, on-screen demonstrations, quizzes and practical peer-reviewed projects designed to give you an opportunity to work with the packages.","Welcome to the courseA warm welcome to Julia Scientific Programming. Over the next four weeks, we will provide you with an introduction to what Julia can offer. We have created a course which we hope will allow you to learn the basics of the language, and stimulate your imagination about how you can use Julia in your own context. This course is all about you exploring Julia - we can only demonstrate some of the capacity and encourage you to take the first steps. For those of you with a programming background, the course is intended to offer a jumpstart into using this language. If you are a novice or beginner programmer, you should follow along the simple coding but recognising that working through the material will not be sufficient to make you a proficient programmer in four weeks. You could see this as the ‘first date’ at the beginning of a long and beautiful new relationship. There is so much you will need to learn and discover. Good luck and we hope you enjoy the course! Best wishes, Henri and JuanA context for exploring Julia: Working with dataIn our case study we use Julia to store, plot, select and slice data from the Ebola epidemic. Taking real data, we explain how to work in Julia using arrays, and for loops to work with the structures. By the end of this module, you will be able to: create an array from data;  learn to use the logical structures IF  and FOR ; conduct basic array slicing, getting the incidence data and generating total number of cases; use Plots to generate graphs and plot data; and combine the Ebola data outputs to show a plot of disease incidence in several countries.Notebooks as Julia Programsin this week, we demonstrate how it is possible to use Julia in the notebook environment to interpret a model and its fit to the data from the Ebola outbreak. For this, we apply the well-known SIR compartmental model in epidemiology. The SIR model labels three compartments, namely S = number susceptible, I =number infectious, and R =number recovered.

You now know how to solve problems, write algorithms, and analyze solutions; and you have a wealth of tools (like data structures) at your disposal.  You may now be ready for an internship or (possibly) an entry-level software engineering job.  But can you land the internship/job?  It depends in part on how well you can solve new technical problems and communicate during interviews.  How can you get better at this?  Practice!  With the support of Google’s recruiting and engineering teams we’ve provided tips, examples, and practice opportunities in this course that may help you with a number of tech companies.  We’ll assist you to organize into teams to practice.  Lastly, we’ll give you basic job search advice, and tips for succeeding once you’re on the job.","Welcome & What is a Software Engineering Interview?Welcome to our course on effectively communicating your technical abilities.  This course focuses on landing a technical job and excelling in a technical role.  To succeed in job interviews, you’ll need to be able to confidently articulate your ability to solve challenging problems and come up with new solutions under potentially stressful conditions. After getting a technical job, the role of communication increases even more.  You’ll need to work with other members of the team, communicate technical challenges and successes, and potentially sell the value of your work to those outside the company. Our goal is that by the end of this course each and every one of you understands the importance of technical communication, and has received constructive feedback on areas of potential improvement.  In achieving this goal you will also learn about algorithmic thinking on the fly, how to evaluate a good interview answer to a difficult technical problem, and how “soft” skills impact interview outcomes.   In this module, we’ll begin to see what a technical interview looks like, from the perspective of a major tech company.  We’ll then focus on how to best get the interview in the first place.  If you're not in the job market right now, you might want to skim the videos in this module and skip ahead to the Resume Critique (for insights about how to present yourself in writing) or the Introductions assignment (on effectively presenting yourself in person).Live coding: the technical phone interview and beyondNow that you’ve gotten warmed up, it’s time to practice your coding skills.  One of the things you’ll almost certainly be asked to do during a technical phone interview is to code up a solution to a problem in a shared text document (e.g. Google doc) while you are on the phone with the interviewer.  This experience can be intimidating, unfamiliar and humbling if you are not prepared, so this week we will give you lots of practice and tips for getting through this part of the interview with flying colors.  Explaining what you've already doneThis week, we’re going to focus on how to speak about your experiences working on projects and how to speak about the technical problems you’ve experienced and how you’ve solved those problems.  We’ll introduce the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Results) model for presenting your work, and discuss how to and how not to present the problem you worked on and the solution you developed.  We’ll also discuss the communication skills that are critical to this task.  It’s a fun week with lots of examples (both good and bad), which ends with an assignment where you will present your own work on video and submit this video for peer review.Algorithmic thinking on the flyAs we saw in week 2, coding on the fly can be a difficult task!  In this final week of the course we’ll revisit the skill of live problem solving by looking at how to solve more challenging algorithmic problems (and write the code associated with the solution) on the whiteboard.  You’ll recognize these problems as “classic” interview problems you’ve probably heard a lot about, designed to test your problem solving skills as well as your analysis and coding abilities.  Don’t worry, we’ll teach you how to approach them with confidence through a 6-step process to addressing technical questions (hint: you don’t have to produce the perfect solution on the first try!).  We’ll show you how to use this process in a number of examples.

Modeling and managing data is a central focus of all big data projects. In these lessons we introduce you to the concepts behind big data modeling and management and set the stage for the remainder of the course. Big Data ModelingModeling big data depends on many factors including data structure, which operations may be performed on the data, and what constraints are placed on the models. In these lessons you will learn the details about big data modeling and you will gain the practical skills you will need for modeling your own big data projects.Big Data Modeling (Part 2)These lessons continue to shed light on big data modeling with specific approaches including vector space models, graph data models, and more. Working With Data ModelsData models deal with many different types of data formats. Streaming data is becoming ubiquitous, and working with streaming data requires a different approach from working with static data. In these lessons you will gain practical hands-on experience working with different forms of streaming data including weather data and twitter feeds. Big Data Management: The ""M"" in DBMSManaging big data requires a different approach to database management systems because of the wide variation in data structure which does not lend itself to traditional DBMSs. There are many applications available to help with big data management. In these lessons we introduce you to some of these applications and provide insight into how and when they might be appropriate for your own big data management challenges.

This course will cover advanced topics in finding mutations lurking within DNA and proteins.In the first half of the course, we would like to ask how an individual's genome differs from the ""reference genome"" of the species. Our goal is to take small fragments of DNA from the individual and ""map"" them to the reference genome.  We will see that the combinatorial pattern matching algorithms solving this problem are elegant and extremely efficient, requiring a surprisingly small amount of runtime and memory.In the second half of the course, we will learn how to identify the function of a protein even if it has been bombarded by so many mutations compared to similar proteins with known functions that it has become barely recognizable.  This is the case, for example, in HIV studies, since the virus often mutates so quickly that researchers can struggle to study it.  The approach we will use is based on a powerful machine learning tool called a hidden Markov model.Finally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools applying hidden Markov models to compare a protein against a related family of proteins.",N/A,Free Online Course (Audit),Upcoming,English,"8th Apr, 2019",4-10 hours a week,6 weeks long,"[""Pavel  Pevzner"",""Phillip Compeau""]"

Through your own PC/laptop, you can easily learn everything about the Internet, and that is what this course is focused on. In this course ‘Introduction to TCP/IP,’ you will learn the operational functions of Internet technologies (which include IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, addressing, routing, domain names, etc.) and your PC/laptop's security and gateway Internet setup and basic principles. In addition, through a simple Wireshark experiment, you will see the TCP/IP packets and security systems in action that are serving your PC/laptop, that serves you.","My PC's Internet & GatewayFor the course 'Introduction to TCP/IP,' the first module is 'My PC's Internet & Gateway,' which introduced all important functions of the Internet that you use from your PC (Personal Computer), laptop, or smartphone. The first lecture 'My PC’s Internet Setup' explains the setup used in your PC/laptop. The next lecture 'Automatic Internet Setup using DHCP,' shows how your PC/laptop’s Internet connection is automatically setup if a local DHCP Server is supporting your network. Then the focus moves to the Default Gateway configuration in the 'IP Gateway/Router Configuration' lectures. As the Default Gateway is the gateway to the Internet for your PC/laptop, the lecture 'IP Routing Table' shows how the Default Gateway sends and receives all packets for your PC/laptop.TCP/IP ProtocolThe second module 'TCP/IP Protocol' focuses on all protocol and functional aspects of the TCP and IP operations used in your PC/laptop/smartphone. The first lecture ‘TCP/IP 5 Layers & Operations’ provides an easy-to-understand description of how TCP/IP works in the Internet to transfer information, using a comparable example of how postal mail is delivered. The lectures ‘IPv4’ and ‘IPv6’ describe how the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols are structured and how they operate. In addition, the CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation as well as the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and subnets are explained. Then the lectures on ‘UDP’ and ‘TCP’ describe how the port number works and how TCP conducts flow control and detects errors in the packets you received on your PC/laptop/smartphone.Internet Routing & FunctionsThe third module ‘Internet Routing & Functions’ focuses on the main protocols and functions used in the Internet that you have been using every day to make network connections. The lecture ‘IGP vs. EGP’ is focused on the types and functions of IGPs (Interior Gateway Protocols) and EGPs (Exterior Gateway Protocols). The lecture ‘OSPF’ describes how OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) sets up SPT (Shortest Path Tree) routing paths, which makes your Internet connections more reliable and fast. The lectures ‘ARP’ and ‘NAT’ explains how you have used ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and NAT (Network Address Translation) to inter-changing IP addresses for access to private networks and how your PC/laptop/smartphone had been finding IP addresses from web host names. The lectures ‘RPC’ and ‘FTP’ describes how RPC (Remote Procedure Call) had been enabling you to make connections to remote computers/servers, and how FTP (File Transfer Protocol) helped you move files from a remote computer/server to your PC/laptop so quickly. The last lecture ‘E-mail’ compares the characteristics of IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) and POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) and how they operate in serving your all your e-mails.Internet SecurityThe module ‘Internet Security’ focuses on the most popular Internet attack types and describes the methods used by your PC/laptop/smartphone to prevent and defend against cyber attacks. The first lecture ‘Top Ranking Internet Attacks’ describes the most commonly occurring attack types and ranks them based on the percentage of attack incidents. Your PC/laptop/smartphone has been receiving these attacks 100%, you just did not know it, but now you will. The lecture ‘Growing Security & Threat Issues’ discusses about zombie computers and botnets and other emerging attack techniques, which may be contaminating your PC/laptop/smartphone. The lectures in ‘Internet & Cyber Attacks’ include the most serious cyber attack types of Phishing, DoS (Denial of Service) & DDoS (Distributed DoS), Overflow, MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) Attack, and SQL (Structured Query Language) Injection. The lectures in ‘Internet Security & Protection’ focus on the most commonly used attack defense/security techniques used by your PC/laptop/smartphone, which include Firewalls, IDS (Intrusion Detection System), TLS (Transport Layer Security), WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access), WPA2, and SSH (Secure Shell).

Organizations need to scale up and expand to cater for the ever-increasing market demand. Businesses proliferate mainly inorganically, through mergers and acquisitions. The need is to onboard newly acquired subsidiaries, which may be in different geographical locations and with a different set of established business processes, into existing IT systems, or integrate the disparate IT systems of multiple entities.Organic growth is achieved by diversifying lines of business (LoB), where existing IT systems need to be adapted for new LoB-related business processes. In addition to all this, businesses are feeling the need to integrate with the extended supply chain comprising vendors, sub-contractors, distributors, and so on, in different IT landscapes.In a digital economy, two-tier ERP attempts to solve this paradox of seamlessly integrating multiple ERP landscapes.

Learn how to create “world-ready” software from expert programmers who have developed international software for some of the world’s most successful companies.Developing international software involves far more than translating the User Interface. You must sharpen your business acumen to determine whether shipping software to a specific market is even worth the effort. You must deepen your knowledge of cultural differences so you don’t include a feature, visual, or turn of phrase that offends potential customers. You must understand that differences in language affect input methods, sorting orders, text layout, fonts, and dialog box sizes, and that countries use different currency symbols, number formats, keyboard layouts, and measurement systems--and you should internalize all of this before you write a single line of code.In this era of rapid development and intense competition, it is tempting to focus on what’s “most important” first, leaving the rest for later;but waiting until the end of the software development cycle to start thinking about markets outside of your own is a strategy that can result in delays or embarrassing failures, costing you time and money, alienating potential customers, and damaging your brand.In this course, programmers who have developed international software for some of the world’s most successful companies will teach you the secrets to creating a “world-ready” software design and codebase that will make shipping software to markets around the world a smoother, less expensive, and less time-consuming process.

Combining the simplicity of MiniZinc with the power of open-source industrial solving technologies, you will learn how to solve tricky Cryptarithm puzzles with great ease.Core DecisionsIn this module you will examine some of the archetypal forms of decisions that need to be made in discrete optimization problems and how to represent them in MiniZinc. After this module Sudoku problems will never bother you again.Multiple PerspectivesIn this module you will see how discrete optimization problems can often be seen from multiple viewpoints, and modelled completely differently from each viewpoint. Each viewpoint may have strengths and weaknesses, and indeed the different models can be combined to help each other.  You will learn more about converting data into complex constraints or objectives to define a problem.  The assignment will challenge you far more than earlier problems.The Power of PredicatesYou will learn how to encapsulate a complex constraint definition in a predicate definition to enable its reuse.  This will enable the construction of far more complex models.  You will learn methods to discover what is going wrong with your model and how to fix it.  With these tools a complex plannning problem will be easy to solve.Challenging ApplicationsYou will learn how to tackle challenging scheduling and packing problems, and the important combinatorial substructures that underly them.  You will see how to model some of the complex constraints that arise in these applications. The assignment will tackle a simplification of a real world combined scheduling and packing problem.Other Topics (optional)In this optional module you will get more insight into the type system of MiniZinc and how MiniZinc models are transformed to a form suitable for solving. Option types are used by MiniZinc to allow flexible specification of loops, and you may have experienced confusing error messages involving them, this will be much clearer after this module. Flattening explains how MiniZinc models are translated to solvers, giving you more insight into why some models are more efficient than others.Under the Hood (optional)This optional module gives insight into how the solvers used by MiniZinc actually work. With greater understanding of the solvers you can create more efficient models. Constraint programming (CP) solvers, like Gecode, also allow search to be programmed in the MiniZinc model, and this can make solving far more efficient.

More specifically, the course studies cryptography from the information-theoretical perspectives and discuss the concepts such as entropy and the attacker knowledge capabilities, e.g., Kerckhoff's Principle. It also contrasts information-theoretic security and computational security to highlight the different train of thoughts that drive the cryptographic algorithmic construction and the security analyses.This course is a part of the Applied Cryptography specialization.","Cryptography OverviewThis module defines the technical terms in cryptography and introduce Alice, Bob, and Eve. To study the attacker Eve's perspective, we will describe Kerckhoff's Principle (""the attacker knows the system""), which defines the scope of the attacker knowledge (what is secret vs. what the attacker can know). We will also describe Security by Obscurity, which contrasts Kerckhoff's Principle. Information EntropyThis module studies information entropy to quantify randomness. Information entropy can be used to measure the strength of the key or the secret information that determines the security of a cryptosystem against an attacker who does not know the random key. Brute-Force Attack and CryptanalysisThis module studies the attacker view whose objective is to learn the key and break the cryptographic protection using the key. First, we will define brute force attack and describe how to quantify the attacker effort for brute force attack. Next, we will contrast cryptanalysis and brute force attack. Lastly, we will discuss about perfect secrecy, which is immune to cryptanalysis and is a strong notion of security derived from information theory.

Don’t worry, you’re not alone here. The prominence of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, two applications built on blockchain foundations, has significantly increased the coverage the technology receives. Unfortunately, it has also fueled a wider misunderstanding of what it is, when it can be used, and the benefits it can bring to an existing process. Do you want to step away from the confusion? If so, “An Introduction to Blockchain” can help you. Blockchain, one of the emerging technologies offered as part of SAP Leonardo, is often explained in terms of its decentralization, it’s distributed ledgers, and its immutability. Whilst these are integral aspects of blockchain, they don’t provide the complete picture of this much talked about technology. In “An Introduction to Blockchain” we’ll move beyond the buzzwords though and offer a more detailed look into the technology’s emergence, the solutions it can provide, and its potential uses in a wide number of industries.The course starts by addressing the difference between blockchain and crypto-currencies, and then gathers momentum with a practical example of how the technology can be used as a solution to issues faced in current business transactions. By understanding how blockchain solves real life situations, you’ll start to not only understand its key components but also see its benefits, its application, and even its weaknesses.In addition to use cases, this course also provides a high-level look into the technology itself. Here you’ll learn about the jigsaw of existing technologies that are combined to create blockchain, many of which you’ll find in everyday use.Whilst understanding the key terms and the technology are important, this course goes further to also allow you to identify blockchain’s value drivers, helping you to assess whether it’s a suitable solution for a project or process.

Many of these problems can be reduced to one of the classical problems called NP-complete problems which either cannot be solved by a polynomial algorithm or solving any one of them would win you a million dollars (see Millenium Prize Problems) and eternal worldwide fame for solving the main problem of computer science called P vs NP. It's good to know this before trying to solve a problem before the tomorrow's deadline :) Although these problems are very unlikely to be solvable efficiently in the nearest future, people always come up with various workarounds.

However, don't give up yet! People are creative, and they need to solve these problems anyway, so in practice there are often ways to cope with an NP-complete problem at hand. We show that some special cases on NP-complete problems can, in fact, be solved in polynomial time.Week 3: Coping with NP-completeness: exact and approximate algorithmsWe consider exact algorithms that find a solution much faster than the brute force algorithm.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/udacity-a-b-testing-3528,A/B Testing,Google,Udacity,Software Development,,"This course will cover the design and analysis of A/B tests, also known as split tests, which are online experiments used to test potential improvements to a website or mobile application. Two versions of the website are shown to different users - usually the existing website and a potential change. Then, the results are analyzed to determine whether the change is an improvement worth launching. This course will cover how to choose and characterize metrics to evaluate your experiments, how to design an experiment with enough statistical power, how to analyze the results and draw valid conclusions, and how to ensure that the the participants of your experiments are adequately protected.Why Take This Course?A/B testing, or split testing, is used by companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Ebay/Paypal, Netflix, and numerous others to decide which changes are worth launching. By using A/B tests to make decisions, you can base your decisions on actual data, rather than relying on intuition or HiPPO's - the highest paid person's opinion! Designing good A/B tests and drawing valid conclusions can be difficult. You can almost never measure exactly what you want to know (such as whether the users are ""happier"" on one version of the site), so you need to find good proxies. You need sanity checks to make sure your experimental set-up isn't flawed, and you need to use a variety of statistical techniques to make sure the results you're seeing aren't due to chance. This course will walk you through the entire process. At the end, you will be ready to help businesses small or large make crucial decisions that could significantly affect their future!","Lesson 1: Overview of A/B TestingThis lesson will cover what A/B testing is and what it can be used for. It will also cover an example A/B test from start to finish, including how to decide how long to run the experiment, how to construct a binomial confidence interval for the results, and how to decide whether the change is worth the launch cost.Lesson 2: Policy and Ethics for ExperimentsThis lesson will cover how to make sure the participants of your experiments are adequately protected and what questions you should be asking regarding the ethicality of experiments. It will cover four main ethics principles to consider when designing experiments: the risk to the user, the potential benefits, what alternatives users have to participating in the experiment, and the sensitivity of the data being collected.Lesson 3: Choosing and Characterizing MetricsOne of the most important and time-consuming pieces of designing an A/B test is choosing and validating metrics to use in evaluating your experiment. This lesson will cover techniques for brainstorming metrics, what to do when you can't measure what you want directly, and characteristics you should consider when validating your metrics.Lesson 4: Designing an ExperimentThis lesson will cover how to design an A/B test. This includes how to choose which users will be in your experiment and control group - different online definitions of a ""user"", and what effects different choices will have on your experiment. It will also cover when to  limit your experiment to a subset of your entire user base, how to calculate how many events you will need in order to draw strong conclusions from your results, and how this translates into how long to run the experiment. Finally, the lesson will cover how various design decisions affect the size of your experiment, so you will know which decisions to revisit if you need results more quickly.Lesson 5: Analyzing ResultsThis lesson will cover how to analyze the results of your experiments. Step one is always to run some sanity checks so that you can catch problems with your experiment set-up. Then, you will learn how to check conclusions with multiple methods, including a hypothesis test on the effect size and a binomial sign test, if you get results that surprise you. You will also learn how measuring multiple metrics for the same experiment can make analysis difficult, and some techniques for handling multiple metrics. Finally, you will learn about several analysis ""gotchas"", and what to do if you see them, including how Simpson's Paradox can affect A/B tests, and why even statistically significant results might disappear when you launch.Final Project: Design and Analyze an A/B TestMake design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-principles-of-machine-learning-r-edition-11602,Probabilistic Graphical Models 2: Inference,Stanford University,Coursera,Artificial Intelligence,,"Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are a rich framework for encoding probability distributions over complex domains: joint (multivariate) distributions over large numbers of random variables that interact with each other. These representations sit at the intersection of statistics and computer science, relying on concepts from probability theory, graph algorithms, machine learning, and more. They are the basis for the state-of-the-art methods in a wide variety of applications, such as medical diagnosis, image understanding, speech recognition, natural language processing, and many, many more. They are also a foundational tool in formulating many machine learning problems. This course is the second in a sequence of three. Following the first course, which focused on representation, this course addresses the question of probabilistic inference: how a PGM can be used to answer questions. Even though a PGM generally describes a very high dimensional distribution, its structure is designed so as to allow questions to be answered efficiently. The course presents both exact and approximate algorithms for different types of inference tasks, and discusses where each could best be applied. The (highly recommended) honors track contains two hands-on programming assignments, in which key routines of the most commonly used exact and approximate algorithms are implemented and applied to a real-world problem.","Inference Overview This module provides a high-level overview of the main types of inference tasks typically encountered in graphical models: conditional probability queries, and finding the most likely assignment (MAP inference).Variable EliminationThis module presents the simplest algorithm for exact inference in graphical models: variable elimination. We describe the algorithm, and analyze its complexity in terms of properties of the graph structure.Belief Propagation Algorithms This module describes an alternative view of exact inference in graphical models: that of message passing between clusters each of which encodes a factor over a subset of variables. This framework provides a basis for a variety of exact and approximate inference algorithms. We focus here on the basic framework and on its instantiation in the exact case of clique tree propagation. An optional lesson describes the loopy belief propagation (LBP) algorithm and its properties.MAP AlgorithmsThis module describes algorithms for finding the most likely assignment for a distribution encoded as a PGM (a task known as MAP inference). We describe message passing algorithms, which are very similar to the algorithms for computing conditional probabilities, except that we need to also consider how to decode the results to construct a single assignment. In an optional module, we describe a few other algorithms that are able to use very different techniques by exploiting the combinatorial optimization nature of the MAP task.Sampling MethodsIn this module, we discuss a class of algorithms that uses random sampling to provide approximate answers to conditional probability queries. Most commonly used among these is the class of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, which includes the simple Gibbs sampling algorithm, as well as a family of methods known as Metropolis-Hastings.Inference in Temporal ModelsIn this brief lesson, we discuss some of the complexities of applying some of the exact or approximate inference algorithms that we learned earlier in this course to dynamic Bayesian networks.Inference SummaryThis module summarizes some of the topics that we covered in this course and discusses tradeoffs between different algorithms.

It will teach you how to extract and identify useful features that best represent your data, a few of the most important machine learning algorithms, and how to evaluate the performance of your machine learning algorithms.This course is also a part of our Data Analyst Nanodegree.Why Take This Course?In this course, you’ll learn by doing! We’ll bring machine learning to life by showing you fascinating use cases and tackling interesting real-world problems like self-driving cars. For your final project you’ll mine the email inboxes and financial data of Enron to identify persons of interest in one of the greatest corporate fraud cases in American history.When you finish this introductory course, you’ll be able to analyze data using machine learning techniques, and you’ll also be prepared to take our Data Analyst Nanodegree. We’ll get you started on your machine learning journey by teaching you how to use helpful tools, such as pre-written algorithms and libraries, to answer interesting questions.","You’ll learn how to start with a question and/or a dataset, and use machine learning to turn them into insights. Lessons 1-4: Supervised ClassificationNaive Bayes: We jump in headfirst, learning perhaps the world’s greatest algorithm for classifying text.Support Vector Machines (SVMs): One of the top 10 algorithms in machine learning, and a must-try for many classification tasks.  What makes it special?  The ability to generate new features independently and on the fly.Decision Trees: Extremely straightforward, often just as accurate as an SVM but (usually) way faster.  The launch point for more sophisticated methods, like random forests and boosting.Lesson 5: Datasets and QuestionsBehind any great machine learning project is a great dataset that the algorithm can learn from.  We were inspired by a treasure trove of email and financial data from the Enron corporation, which would normally be strictly confidential but became public when the company went bankrupt in a blizzard of fraud.  Follow our lead as we wrestle this dataset into a machine-learning-ready format, in anticipation of trying to predict cases of fraud.Lesson 6 and 7: Regressions and OutliersRegressions are some of the most widely used machine learning algorithms, and rightly share prominence with classification.  What’s a fast way to make mistakes in regression, though?  Have troublesome outliers in your data.  We’ll tackle how to identify and clean away those pesky data points.Lesson 8: Unsupervised LearningK-Means Clustering: The flagship algorithm when you don’t have labeled data to work with, and a quick method for pattern-searching when approaching a dataset for the first time.Lessons 9-12: Features, Features, FeaturesFeature Creation: Taking your human intuition about the world and turning it into data that a computer can use.Feature Selection: Einstein said it best: make everything as simple as possible, and no simpler.  In this case, that means identifying the most important features of your data.Principal Component Analysis: A more sophisticated take on feature selection, and one of the crown jewels of unsupervised learning.Feature Scaling: Simple tricks for making sure your data and your algorithm play nicely together.Learning from Text: More information is in text than any other format, and there are some effective but simple tools for extracting that information.Lessons 13-14: Validation and EvaluationTraining/testing data split: How do you know that what you’re doing is working?  You don’t, unless you validate.  The train-test split is simple to do, and the gold standard for understanding your results.Cross-validation: Take the training/testing split and put it on steroids.  Validate your machine learning results like a pro.Precision, recall, and F1 score:  After all this data-driven work, quantify your results with metrics tailored to what is most important to you.Lesson 15: Wrapping it all UpWe take a step back and review what we’ve learned, and how it all fits together.

Just a few years ago, this was unthinkable: many ‘cutting edge’ firms would release software quarterly. When it comes to digital innovation, velocity is critical and many would say it’s the most reliable determinant of success. Bringing an organization to the state of the art (or even functional capability) in this area requires strong work in a combination of disciplines and a combination of both technical and managerial skills. There is no single cookie-cutter approach for achieving this capability. Much like agile, the right focus and formulation depends a lot on the facts and circumstances of the team. This course will provide you with the interdisciplinary skill set to cultivate a continuous deployment capability in your organization. After completing this course, you will be able to: 1. Diagnose a team’s delivery pipeline and bring forward prioritized recommendations to improve it2. Explain the skill sets and roles involved in DevOps and how they contribute toward a continuous delivery capability3. Review and deliver automation tests across the development stack4.

This course is exam preparation for Unity's Expert Gameplay Programmer Certification Exam. This course will challenge you with a series of realistic programming problems in Unity video-game projects, inspired by one or more of the topics covered in the Expert Gameplay Programmer Exam. Throughout this course, you will learn various optimization techniques, including: optimizing for different platforms, understanding how platform differences can impact gameplay, using Asset Bundle configuration tools, gameplay debugging, and rendering optimization. By the end of this course, you will optimize a 3D ""Dual-Stick Survivor"" game project for WebGL. This is an advanced-level course, intended for industry game developers or very experienced Unity enthusiasts who are looking to “level-up” their gameplay programming and implementation strategies. To succeed in this courses, you should have at least 2-3 years of experience developing games with Unity. You should be familiar with the full-game lifecycle (working from early concept to launch), creating and working with Prefabs, understanding game asset and animation pipelines, and have some experience with Unity Services. You should also have advanced programming skills, particularly in the C# language.","Rendering OptimizationFor the first week of this course, you’ll begin by optimizing your rendering process.  You’ll need to take advantage of Occlusion Culling and LODs to achieve this.  By analyzing fill rates and hunting down drops in the frame rate, you’ll make sure your game is displaying smoothly to your user.Asset BundlesLong gone are the days of games released and considered final.  DLC has expanded the life expectancy of games, some even into decade-long legacies.  Other games have found great success in offer customizations that can be downloaded.  The rise in mobile gaming has seen DLC as a means on minimizing wait times for players.  Unity’s Asset Bundles provide a solution to all these situations, and more for the clever programmer.This week you’ll be determining the optimal configurations to support efficient Asset Bundle integration with your game.  You’ll need to analyze needs and issues to determine the best package sizes and methods, and determine the solutions required.Gameplay DebuggingAs games get more complex, so do our bugs.  Even if every line of code worked on the first try (it never does) you’d still stumble across strange behaviours arising from unforeseen interactions or unintended behaviours.  Not every bug is a game-killer, though, and learning to prioritize those from the annoying-but-harmless is a key skill of any programmer.This week you’ll be debugging your game for issues in level gameplay, NPC interaction, and scene transitions.  Of course, every issue requires a solution, though some bugs will need to be prioritized ahead of others.  After identifying what needs immediate fixing, it will be your duty to recommend solutions based on scene analysis.Platform ConstraintsNot all the platforms are the same, and games that plan to run on multiple platforms have to take this into consideration.  Beyond the differences between one computer and the next, today’s gaming market spans smartphones, tablets, and consoles.  Users are viewing games on phone screens and widescreen televisions and VR goggles.  They’re mashing buttons, tilting controllers, gesturing, and literally yelling commands.  How does that affect your game?This week you’ll consider the impact different platforms have on the input methods available to the user.  You’ll also analyze what storage and system resources are available per platform, and devise methods for running your game under those constraints.Platform OptimizationPlayers expect a game to run smoothly on the device it’s advertised for.  Games that drop frames or consume too much memory will lead to frustration.  Thankfully there are a number of tools to help us identify and solve such issues before they ever reach our players, even across multiple platforms. This week you’ll start optimizing your game’s performance using the Profiler.  You’ll need to analyze what resources you’re using, including CPU, GPU, and system memory.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/coursera-quantitative-formal-modeling-and-worst-case-performance-analysis-4864,Quantitative Formal Modeling and Worst-Case Performance Analysis,EIT Digital,Coursera,Algorithms and Data Structures,,"Welcome to Quantitative Formal Modeling and Worst-Case Performance Analysis. In this course, you will learn about modeling and solving performance problems in a fashion popular in theoretical computer science, and generally train your abstract thinking skills.   After finishing this course, you have learned to think about the behavior of systems in terms of token production and consumption, and you are able to formalize this thinking mathematically in terms of prefix orders and counting functions. You have learned about Petri-nets, about timing, and about scheduling of token consumption/production systems, and for the special class of Petri-nets known as single-rate dataflow graphs, you will know how to perform a worst-case analysis of basic performance metrics, like throughput, latency and buffering.Disclaimer: As you will notice, there is an abundance of small examples in this course, but at first sight there are not many industrial size systems being discussed. The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, it is not my intention to teach you performance analysis skills up to the level of what you will need in industry. Rather, I would like to teach you to think about modeling and performance analysis in general and abstract terms, because that is what you will need to do whenever you encounter any performance analysis problem in the future. After all, abstract thinking is the most revered skill required for any academic-level job in any engineering discipline, and if you are able to phrase your problems mathematically, it will become easier for you to spot mistakes, to communicate your ideas with others, and you have already made a big step towards actually solving the problem. Secondly, although dataflow techniques are applicable and being used in industry, the subclass of single-rate dataflow is too restrictive to be of practical use in large modeling examples. The analysis principles of other dataflow techniques, however, are all based on single-rate dataflow. So this course is a good primer for any more advanced course on the topic.This course is part of the university course on Quantitative Evaluation of Embedded Systems (QEES) as given in the Embedded Systems master curriculum of the EIT-Digital university, and of the Dutch 3TU consortium consisting of TU/e (Eindhoven), TUD (Delft) and UT (Twente). The course material is exactly the same as the first three weeks of QEES, but the examination of QEES is at a slightly higher level of difficulty, which cannot (yet) be obtained in an online course.","IntroductionThis course is part of a Blended Master Programme in Embedded Systems. Modeling systems as token consumption/production systemsIn this module/week you will learn to draw a model of a token consumption/production system, and communicate your interpretation of this model with others in an informal manner. At the end of this model, you will be able to draw your own models, and explain your interpretation of them in general terms. Also, you will know about the standard Petri-net interpretation of consumption/production systems, and will be able to point out particular patterns in Petri-net models. Finally, you will be able to refine a consumption/production model into a model that contains sufficient information to allow worst-case performance analysis. This is all tested using a peer-reviewed assignment. Syntax and semanticsIn this module/week, you will be really training your abstract thinking skills. After finishing this module, you will have learned how to formalize the behavior of any dynamical system as a prefix order, and how to formalize the interpretation of a consumption/production system as a counting function on such a prefix order. You understand how the Petri-net interpretation puts certain restrictions on these counting functions, and how you can exploit those restrictions to prove properties about Petri-net interpretations, without knowing the actual interpretation itself. At the end of the module, you will practice the formalization of performance metrics as logical properties of counting functions, by recognizing right and wrong examples of formalization. Those who are already familiar with Petri-net theory, may find that the prefix order semantics that I introduce in this course is slightly different from what they are used to. Traditional Petri-net semantics is usually based on markings, transition systems, or the execution trees thereoff. Execution trees are a particular example of a prefix order, but in general prefix orders offer the added flexibility that they do not restrict the user to discrete interpretations of behavior only. This is particularly suitable when seeking connection between theoretical computer science and an application field like embedded systems, from which this course originates, where also the continuous behavior of physical systems has to be taken into account.Performance analysisIn this module/week you will learn to exploit the structure of single-rate dataflow graphs to perform worst-case analysis of performance metrics like throughput, latency and buffering. After this week, you know how to calculate the maximum cycle mean of a dataflow graph, how to construct a periodic schedule for it, how to optimize this schedule for latency analysis, and how to determine the size of buffers with back-pressure such that the worst-case analysis remains valid. If you understood the material of the previous module/week, the proofs presented in this week will give you a deeper understanding of the mathematical underpinning of these methods.One final exampleIn this last week, we just discuss one more example, following the outline of the peer-reviewed assignment of the first module/week. It's just a little summary, combining everything we have learned so far, and there is some additional reading material to trigger an appetite for further discovery.",Free Online Course (Audit),In progress,English,"18th Mar, 2019",N/A,4 weeks long,"[""Dr.ir.

We will focus on the ingredients required for this process: data collection and analysis.You won't learn how to use qualitative methods by just watching video's, so we put much stress on collecting data through observation and interviewing and on analysing and interpreting the collected data in other assignments.Obviously, the most important concepts in qualitative research will be discussed, just as we will discuss quality criteria, good practices, ethics, writing some methods of analysis, and mixing methods.We hope to take away some prejudice, and enthuse many students for qualitative research.","Philosophy of Qualitative ResearchWelcome to the first week of the course. We start with an introduction, followed by two lessons on the  Philosophy of Qualitative Research.ObservationIn the first module we discussed the philosophy of qualitative research, explaining some basic notions and general philosophical approaches. In this second module we'll discuss observation as an important method within qualitative research. What types of observation are there? How do we observe? And how do we analyse and describe our data? Good Practices & CriteriaWhat makes qualitative research 'good' is a rather difficult question. Different criteria are suggested, but within the field of qualitative research there is not much agreement on these criteria. However, there is quite some agreement on what good practices of qualitative research are. In this module we will start in lesson 1 with a  discussion of  good practices of qualitative research.Qualitative InterviewingIn this module we'll look at what a qualitative interview entails by trying to define it and by discussing different forms of interviewing behaviour. Qualitative AnalysisIn previous modules we discussed how you should observe a social situation or conduct a qualitative interview. Now we will focus on what to do with your data, by discussing qualitative analysis. In this module you will try to do a qualitative analysis by interpreting your observed data and try to code it. Writing, mixing & ethicsIn this module I will discuss ideas on writing in qualitative research, I will discuss mixing methods  and talk about the ethical issues you should consider.

When the amount of data available is enormous, it helps if some of the analysis can be automated. Machine learning is a way of identifying patterns in data and using them to automatically make predictions or decisions. In this data science course, you will learn basic concepts and elements of machine learning.The two main methods of machine learning you will focus on are regression and classification. Regression is used when you seek to predict a numerical quantity. Classification is used when you try to predict a category (e.g., given information about a financial transaction, predict whether it is fraudulent or legitimate).For regression, you will learn how to measure the correlation between two variables and compute a best-fit line for making predictions when the underlying relationship is linear. The course will also teach you how to quantify the uncertainty in your prediction using the bootstrap method. These techniques will be motivated by a wide range of examples. For classification, you will learn the k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm, learn how to measure the effectiveness of your classifier, and apply it to real-world tasks including medical diagnoses and predicting genres of movies.

This course will challenge you with a series of realistic programming problems in Unity video-game projects, inspired by one or more of the topics covered in the Expert Gameplay Programmer Exam. Throughout this course, you will work on a 2D “infinite platformer” game project. This will help you practice prototyping core game play mechanics, including scripting GameObjects and their components, coordinating UI systems, and implementing UI scripting. You will also identify conflicts and implement solutions during the prototype stage. This is an advanced-level course, intended for industry game developers or very experienced Unity enthusiasts who are looking to “level-up” their gameplay programming and implementation strategies. To succeed in this courses, you should have at least 2-3 years of experience developing games with Unity. You should be familiar with the full-game lifecycle (working from early concept to launch), creating and working with Prefabs, understanding game asset and animation pipelines, and have some experience with Unity Services. You should also have advanced programming skills, particularly in the C# language.","Core Gameplay PrototypingFor the first week of this course, you’ll get practice in identifying and configuring the required Components and key features for a game prototype from an analysis of a Game Design Document. You’ll develop the technical design for basic user controls, and behaviors for the player’s character and the NPCs, and then implement them.UI Coordinate SystemsProviding feedback to the player is crucial for a game prototype, and nothing works as well to provide feedback as the User Interface. A UI has to be carefully constructed to deliver this feedback, though, and it has to be responsive. Thus knowledge of the various ways UI can be implemented into a game and how it performs across various devices is key to success. This week you’ll be having a look at the various UI coordinate systems in order to determine which best supports your game’s mechanics. Then you’ll implement a basic UI, keeping the aspect ratios of varying devices in mind, all while optimizing the UI's performance. When you’re done, you’ll have a UI that, once wired up to the appropriate game code, will provide valuable feedback. But most importantly, it won’t detract from the gameplay experience.UI ScriptingYour UI is ready to provide feedback, and for that it needs data and methods of translating that data into visuals that user can quickly absorb. From simple meters for health or time, to complex maps showing player progress or proximity, these elements need to run smoothly and accurately. If your game must be localized into multiple languages, you’ll have to plan and execute for that, too. This week you’ll delve into the scripting side of UI.  You’ll hook up last week’s UI to your gameplay, and add new features derived from scene data. All this has to perform well, which will require a look at the UI Profiler to determine how to optimize per platform. For elements that require localization, you’ll use a script to determine which assets need to be replaced. When you’re done, your UI will give you real-time feedback on your gameplay.Conflicts & Solutions During PrototypeThe reason we prototype is to test an idea before fully committing to it.  Ideas that sound amazing on paper may need a lot of tweaking, or may work great except for one big loophole.  They may be completely infeasible, but through prototyping lead to something even better.  By analyzing gameplay and making adjustments where needed, you can make a good idea into an amazing game. In this last week of Rapid Prototyping, you’ll be verifying the functioning of your procedural level generation and analyzing your prototype for any other conflicts in gameplay.  Of course you’ll need to identify solutions for those conflicts should they emerge, and further prototype solutions.  Some prototypes are made only to test an idea, while many go on to become the game should the idea be successful.  Your prototype will be a fully playable game, ready for you to expand and iterate upon.",Free Online Course (Audit),Upcoming,English,"25th Mar, 2019",6-8 hours a week,4 weeks long,"[""Unity Technologies"",""Dustin Carroll""]"

You should also have advanced programming skills, particularly in the C# language.","Configuring PhysicsFor the first week of this course, you’ll begin working on a Dual-Stick Survivor game incorporating Unity’s physics engine. You’ll begin by deciding what GameObjects needs Colliders and Rigidbodies, and how those should be configured. Then you’ll use these to set up gameplay events. All this has to be done in a efficient, optimized manner. You’ll finish this module with a level in which your game will take place, set up with physical interactions.Spawning Runtime Prefabs & EffectsThe number of objects present in a game can quickly reach astronomical numbers.  This can present an organizational and performance problem, which is why spawning objects during runtime and managing effects is crucial.  Knowing what to spawn where and how often is a key skill for any game programmer. Balancing these assets will allow you to create bigger, more extravagant games using the same or fewer resources, if you know how to evaluate your game’s needs and the target platform’s capabilities. This week you’ll begin populating your level with Prefabs, Particle Systems, and Effects.  You’ll identify objects that should be placed in the Scene file, and those that should be spawned at runtime.  The latter will require analysis to make certain it doesn’t impact gameplay negatively.  Finally you’ll hook up these spawning items to scene events, making your level feel very responsive to a player’s actions.Level Logic & BehaviourGiving life to a scene and a game requires giving it purpose, and purpose demands logic.  Driving events through state machines and events allows you to control the game’s flow, and gives the player something to react and think against.  Managing your game at the highest level requires thinking about how the whole thing works together. This week you’ll manage your game’s logical flow by introducing Animation System States, State Machine Behaviours, and Animation Events.  You’ll need to evaluate the needs of the gameplay in order to trigger events and manage the scene.  By analyzing the GDD and using its vision as logic, you’ll begin to bring gameplay to life.Loading and Unloading ScenesMost games span multiple levels, and it simply wouldn’t be efficient to include those in one giant scene.  Even games that could be one scene would likely benefit from loading and unloading scenes, if they analyze their needs smartly.  A clever transition from one scene to another only makes gameplay better. This week you’ll begin adding scenes to your game that you’ll need to load and unload without impacting the player’s experience.  By evaluating Unity’s streaming parameters and limits, you’ll devise ways of transitioning users from one part of the game to the other without them even knowing.CinematicsCinematics are a powerful way to progress a story.  Whether pre-rendered or realtime, they allow the game to give players an experience they may not be able to get from just straight gameplay, and in certain cases can fill their imagination with details not possible during normal gameplay. This week you’ll add various cinematics to your game, both in-game and pre-rendered.  This will require suspending gameplay until after the cinematic has finished playing.

Then we focus on the two main measurement technologies: next generation sequencing and microarrays. We then move on to describing how raw data and experimental information are imported into R and how we use Bioconductor classes to organize these data, whether generated locally, or harvested from public repositories or institutional archives. Genomic features are generally identified using intervals in genomic coordinates, and highly efficient algorithms for computing with genomic intervals will be examined in detail. Statistical methods for testing gene-centric or pathway-centric hypotheses with genome-scale data are found in packages such as limma, some of these techniques will be illustrated in lectures and labs.Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures.

Using real-world examples from a wide array of domains including law, medicine and football, you’ll learn how data scientists make conclusions about unknowns based on the data available. Often, the data we have is not complete, yet we’d still like to draw inferences about the world and quantify the uncertainty in our conclusions. This is called statistical inference. In this course, you will learn the framework for statistical inference and apply them to real-world data sets.Notably, you will develop the practice of hypothesis testing—comparing theoretical predictions to actual data, and choosing whether to accept those predictions. This method allows us to evaluate theories or hypotheses about how the world works.You will also learn how to quantify the uncertainty in the conclusions you draw from hypothesis testing. This helps assess whether patterns that appear to be present in the data actually represent a true relationship in the world, or whether they might merely reflect random fluctuations due to noise. Throughout this course, we will go over multiple methods for estimation and hypothesis testing, based on simulations and the bootstrap method.

The topics in this course are timely since the advent of multi-core and distributed-core processors--coupled with ubiquitous wireless and wireline connectivity--is increasing the demand for researchers and practitioners who understand how to successfully develop and deploy concurrent and networked software.Despite continuous improvements in processors and networks during the past four decades, however, developing quality concurrent and networked software remains hard; developing qualityreusableconcurrent and networked software is even harder. The principles, methods, and skills required to develop such software can be greatly enhanced by understanding how to create and apply patterns and frameworks. Apatterndescribes a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a particular context. When related patterns are woven together they form apattern languagethat provides a vocabulary and a process for the orderly resolution of software development problems. Aframeworkis an integrated set of software components that collaborate to provide a reusable architecture for a family of related applications. Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete realizations of pattern languages that facilitate direct reuse of design and code.This course describes how to apply patterns and frameworks to alleviate many accidental and inherent complexities associated with developing and deploying concurrent and networked software. These patterns and frameworks have been used successfully in many domains, including telecom/datacom, mobile devices, electronic medical imaging, network management, aerospace, avionics, automation, online gaming, and financial systems. Over the coming weeks and months I'll illustrate by example how patterns and frameworks simplify and enhance the development of concurrent and networked software via the use of:Object-oriented design concepts and notations -- such as encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, extensibility, and the Unified Modeling Language (UML).Object-oriented programming language features -- such as classes, inheritance, dynamic binding, and parameterized types available in languages like Java, C++, and C#.Middleware -- which is infrastructure software residing between applications and the underlying operating systems, networks, and hardware that encapsulates heterogeneity and enables control over key end-to-end quality-of-service properties, such as dependability and security.Operating system mechanisms -- such as event demultiplexing, multi-threading, multi-processing, and dynamic linking.We'll explore several case studies from the domains of mobile apps, web servers, object request brokers, avionic control systems, and expression tree processing to showcase a time-tested pattern-oriented software design and programming method for concurrent and networked software.","The course is organized as follows:Section 0: Overview of all the topics covered in the course.This material is designed to help you visualize the motivations for--and challenges of--of concurrent and networked software. We also summarize how patterns and frameworks help address key challenges of concurrent and networked software.Section 1: Introduction to concurrency and networking, which provides background info pertaining largely to the OS and middleware layers. We discuss key design dimensions of concurrent and networked software, as well as review common operating system programming mechanisms and Android programming mechanisms. This part focuses on concepts and is generally independent of programming language.Section 2: Overview of patterns and frameworks, which focuses on pattern-oriented software architecture, with an emphasis on concurrent and networked software. We explore key pattern and framework concepts, relationships, and examples, as well as evaluate the pros and cons of patterns and frameworks. Small code examples are shown throughout using C++ and Java, though this section concentrates more on design rather than programming.Section 3: Applying patterns and frameworks to develop concurrent and networked software, which examines lots of code. An open-source web server is used as a running example to illustrate patterns and frameworks pertaining to service access, communication, synchronous event handling, connection establishment, service initialization, service configuration and activation, concurrency and synchronization, and asynchronous event handling. These examples are in C++ usingACE.Appendix: Presents a case study that applies many ""Gang of Four"" patternsthat aren't directly related to concurrent and networked software. Evaluates the limitations with algorithm design and shows how pattern-oriented design alleviates these limtations.

This means that being able to design programs    - or at least be able to work with people who design programs - is becoming    a more and more valuable skill.To build your own programs you need to know two things: how to use the    specific programming language and libraries needed, and the more general    skill of how to design a program.This course presents a design method that will enable you to approach    the design of complex programs systematically. The method will work for    programs in this course as well as hard to design programs you develop    in the future.Using this method you will learn how to model the information in a problem    domain, how to structure program data to mirror that information and how    to further structure the data to lead to a well organized program. You    will also learn to distinguish those parts of a program that are naturally    data driven, from those that should use an alternative algorithmic approach.    The method uses unit-tests to both produce a better developed design, and    to test your program as you develop it.In the first course -- Part 1 -- we use a simple    teaching language to cover the core of the design method. In Part 1 we cover various forms of data; simple interactive programs like games and animations; storing information in and rendering trees; and finally exploring search programs: programs that solve puzzles like Sudoku boards.A second phase of the course, to be offered later, will consist of parallel tracks, with each track using a different popular    programming language and focusing on a different kind of problem.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-blockchain-technology-11428,Blockchain Technology,"University of California, Berkeley",edX,Blockchain and Cryptocurrency,,"Developed by Blockchain at Berkeley and faculty from UC Berkeley's premier Computer Science department, this course provides a wide overview of many of the topics relating to and building upon the foundation of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.The course covers many key topics in the blockchain space. First, we take a look at distributed systems and alternative consensus mechanisms, as well as cryptoeconomic and proof-of-stake. We then move on to the fundamental applications of bitcoin and blockchain technology, including exploring enterprise blockchain implementations (JP Morgan’s Quorum, Ripple, Tendermint, and HyperLedger), the challenges and solutions around scaling blockchain adoption, and the measures that the government is taking to regulate and control blockchain technology. We wrap up the course by also taking a look at the various blockchain ventures today and conclude with a blockchain-based future thought experiment. This course is open to anyone with any background. Whether you are planning your next career move as a blockchain developer, crypto trader, data analyst, researcher, or consultant, or are just looking for an introduction to Blockchain.This course will help you beginto develop the critical skills needed to future-proof your career. This is the second course in the Blockchain Fundamentals Professional Certificate program.","Distributed Systems and Alternative ConsensusBlockchain architecture is built on the foundation of decades of computer science and distributed systems literature. We start out by providing a formal definition of distributed consensus and presenting foundational theoretical computer science topics such as the CAP Theorem and the Byzantine Generals Problem. We then explore alternative consensus mechanisms to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-work, including Proof-of-Stake, voting-based consensus algorithms, and federated consensus.Cryptoeconomics and Proof-of-StakeWe examine the meaning and properties of cryptoeconomics as it relates to its two compositional fields: cryptography and economics. We then look at the goals of cryptoeconomics with respect to distributed systems fundamentals (liveness, safety, data availability) and the griefing factors and faults in the way of these goals.Enterprise Blockchain: Real-World ApplicationsWe look at various existing enterprise-level blockchain implementations, such as JP Morgan’s Quorum, Ripple, Tendermint, and HyperLedger. We also explore business and industry use cases for blockchain, ICOs, and the increasing regulations surrounding blockchain.Scaling Blockchain: Cryptocurrencies for the MassesOne major obstacle to widespread blockchain adoption is the problem of scalability. We define scaling first as it relates to Bitcoin as a payment method, and compare it to more traditional forms of payment such as credit cards. We then consider the general blockchain scalability debate and look into some of the solutions that have been proposed for vertical scaling (e.g. blocksize increases, Segregated Witness, and the Lightning Network), as well as horizontal scaling (e.g. sidechains, sharding). Regulation and AnonymityWe look into the measures that governments have taken to regulate and control blockchain technology. We examine Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, anonymity goals, and government techniques for deanonymization of entities on blockchain. Then from the user’s perspective, we also dive into privacy oriented altcoins and mixing techniques.A Blockchain-Powered FutureA summary of the course and an exploratory look into blockchain ventures today, such as venture capitalism, ICOs, and crowdfunding.

Lesson 1 covers the general concepts of pattern discovery. This includes the basic concepts of frequent patterns, closed patterns, max-patterns, and association rules. Lesson 2 covers three major approaches for mining frequent patterns. We will learn the downward closure (or Apriori) property of frequent patterns and three major categories of methods for mining frequent patterns: the Apriori algorithm, the method that explores vertical data format, and the pattern-growth approach.  We will also discuss how to directly mine the set of closed patterns.Module 2Module 2 covers two lessons: Lessons 3 and 4.  In Lesson 3, we discuss pattern evaluation and learn what kind of interesting measures should be used in pattern analysis. We show that the support-confidence framework is inadequate for pattern evaluation, and even the popularly used lift and chi-square measures may not be good under certain situations. We introduce the concept of null-invariance and introduce a new null-invariant measure for pattern evaluation. In Lesson 4, we examine the issues on mining a diverse spectrum of patterns. We learn the concepts of and mining methods for multiple-level associations, multi-dimensional associations, quantitative associations, negative correlations, compressed patterns, and redundancy-aware patterns.Module 3Module 3 consists of two lessons: Lessons 5 and 6.   In Lesson 5, we discuss mining sequential patterns.   We will learn several popular and efficient sequential pattern mining methods, including an Apriori-based sequential pattern mining method, GSP; a vertical data format-based sequential pattern method, SPADE; and a pattern-growth-based sequential pattern mining method, PrefixSpan. We will also learn how to directly mine closed sequential patterns. In Lesson 6, we will study concepts and methods for mining spatiotemporal and trajectory patterns as one kind of pattern mining applications. We will introduce a few popular kinds of patterns and their mining methods, including mining spatial associations, mining spatial colocation patterns, mining and aggregating patterns over multiple trajectories, mining semantics-rich movement patterns, and mining periodic movement patterns.Week 4Module 4 consists of two lessons: Lessons 7 and 8.   In Lesson 7, we study mining quality phrases from text data as the second kind of pattern mining application. We will mainly introduce two newer methods for phrase mining: ToPMine and SegPhrase, and show frequent pattern mining may be an important role for mining quality phrases in massive text data. In Lesson 8, we will learn several advanced topics on pattern discovery, including mining frequent patterns in data streams, pattern discovery for software bug mining, pattern discovery for image analysis, and pattern discovery and society: privacy-preserving pattern mining.

This course provides the expert guidance and hands-on experience that you need in order to prepare for a successful IoT solution roll-out.  Module 1 provides an overview of the IoT Reference Architecture, introducing Things, Insights and Actions. With a basic understanding of the architecture, students will examine the core and optional subsystems, cross-cutting concerns, principles and concepts of the Reference Architecture, and architecture of key subsystems.  Module 2 uses the Remote Monitoring Solution Accelerator to explore the receipt and processing of remote device telemetry (the most common scenario for IoT) within the context of the Reference Architecture. Students will identify the areas of alignment and where the solution departs from the reference, as well as the tools used to deploy the solution. Students then review some options for customizing the Remote Monitoring solution and complete some customization activities. Students will also review additional accelerator solutions and learn when they may be applicable.  Module 3 introduces students to approaches that can be used to determine and document the business and system requirements that drive key factors such as security, scalability, availability, and disaster recovery service level agreements. They will then apply the requirements, develop a candidate architecture, build a PoC, deliver a cost analysis, and evaluate against quality measures. To finish up the module, students will propose the IoT Hub Operations, Monitoring and Security Processes and Procedures to support the candidate architecture.  In Module 4 students take their defined business requirements and examine how to apply their understanding of IoT Architecture and the capabilities of Azure IoT to create a compelling proposal. They will learn the key attributes of the Azure Cloud and the Azure IoT architecture that should be emphasized, approaches for developing the cost of a proposal and other factors such as support.

Git is open source software originally created by Linus Torvalds. Git manages team files for large and small projects. This allows the team to continuously improve its product. It is used by most major technology companies, and is assumed knowledge for many modern programming and IT jobs.  It is a core component of DevOps, continuous delivery pipelines and cloud-native computing. You could also use Git to manage the many continuously improving revisions of that book that you are writing. In this course, you will not learn everything there is to know about Git, but you will build a strong conceptual understanding of the technology, and afterward will be able to confidently dig deeper on any topic that interests you. This course assumes no previous knowledge of Git, but if you do have experience with it, you may find this course to be both useful and challenging. This is especially true if you currently ""know just enough Git to be dangerous"". There are two paths in this course. Both rely heavily on hands-on labs. One path assumes that you have experience using a command line interface, and the other path uses the Sourcetree graphical client. If you are not experienced with a command line, we highly suggest that you go through the Sourcetree path. Eventually, you might want to go through both paths, so that you can decide which tool to use for specific tasks. Besides, repetition is good for learning :)You can watch the videos and take the quizzes from your phone if you want, but the hands-on labs require you to have a Windows or Mac computer. If you use the command line path through the course, you can also use Linux. This course uses Bitbucket (bitbucket.org) as the hosted provider for remote Git repositories. Bitbucket is free for teams of up to 5 people, including private repositories. However, most of the knowledge that you gain in this course applies to Git itself, and you can apply this knowledge to other hosted Git providers (such as GitHub). This course tries to be as concise as possible.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-amazon-sagemaker-simplifying-machine-learning-application-development-12511,Data Science Ethics,University of Michigan,Coursera,Data Science,,"What are the ethical considerations regarding the privacy and control of consumer information and big data, especially in the aftermath of recent large-scale data breaches?This course provides a framework to analyze these concerns as you examine the ethical and privacy implications of collecting and managing big data. Explore the broader impact of the data science field on modern society and the principles of fairness, accountability and transparency as you gain a deeper understanding of the importance of a shared set of ethical values. You will examine the need for voluntary disclosure when leveraging metadata to inform basic algorithms and/or complex artificial intelligence systems while also learning best practices for responsible data management, understanding the significance of the Fair Information Practices Principles Act and the laws concerning the ""right to be forgotten.""This course will help you answer questions such as who owns data, how do we value privacy, how to receive informed consent and what it means to be fair.Data scientists and anyone beginning to use or expand their use of data will benefit from this course. No particular previous knowledge needed.","What are Ethics?Module 1 of this course establishes a basic foundation in the notion of simple utilitarian ethics we use for this course. The lecture material and the quiz questions are designed to get most people to come to an agreement about right and wrong, using the utilitarian framework taught here. If you bring your own moral sense to bear, or think hard about possible counter-arguments, it is likely that you can arrive at a different conclusion. But that discussion is not what this course is about. So resist that temptation, so that we can jointly lay a common foundation for the rest of this course.History, Concept of Informed ConsentEarly experiments on human subjects were by scientists intent on advancing medicine, to the benefit of all humanity, disregard for welfare of individual human subjects. Often these were performed by white scientists, on black subject. In this module we will talk about the laws that govern the Principle of Informed Consent. We will also discuss why informed consent doesn’t work well for retrospective studies, or for the customers of electronic businesses.Data OwnershipWho owns data about you? We'll explore that question in this module. A few examples of personal data include copyrights for biographies; ownership of photos posted online, Yelp, Trip Advisor, public data capture, and data sale. We'll also explore the limits on recording and use of data. PrivacyPrivacy is a basic human need. Privacy means the ability to control information about yourself, not necessarily the ability to hide things. We have seen the rise different value systems with regards to privacy. Kids today are more likely to share personal information on social media, for example. So while values are changing, this doesn’t remove the fundamental need to be able to control personal information. In this module we'll examine the relationship between the services we are provided and the data we provide in exchange: for example, the location for a cell phone. We'll also compare and contrast ""data"" against ""metadata"".AnonymityCertain transactions can be performed anonymously. But many cannot, including where there is physical delivery of product. Two examples related to anonymous transactions we'll look at are ""block chains"" and ""bitcoin"". We'll also look at some of the drawbacks that come with anonymity.Data ValidityData validity is not a new concern. All too often, we see the inappropriate use of Data Science methods leading to erroneous conclusions. This module points out common errors, in language suited for a student with limited exposure to statistics. We'll focus on the notion of representative sample: opinionated customers, for example, are not necessarily representative of all customers.Algorithmic FairnessWhat could be fairer than a data-driven analysis? Surely the dumb computer cannot harbor prejudice or stereotypes. While indeed the analysis technique may be completely neutral, given the assumptions, the model, the training data, and so forth, all of these boundary conditions are set by humans, who may reflect their biases in the analysis result, possibly without even intending to do so. Only recently have people begun to think about how algorithmic decisions can be unfair. Consider this article, published in the New York Times. This module discusses this cutting edge issue.Societal ConsequencesIn Module 8, we consider societal consequences of Data Science that we should be concerned about even if there are no issues with fairness, validity, anonymity, privacy, ownership or human subjects research. These “systemic” concerns are often the hardest to address, yet just as important as other issues discussed before. For example, we consider ossification, or the tendency of algorithmic methods to learn and codify the current state of the world and thereby make it harder to change. Information asymmetry has long been exploited for the advantage of some, to the disadvantage of others. Information technology makes spread of information easier, and hence generally decreases asymmetry. However, Big Data sets and sophisticated analyses increase asymmetry in favor of those with ability to acquire/access. Code of EthicsFinally, in Module 9, we tie all the issues we have considered together into a simple, two-point code of ethics for the practitioner.AttributionsThis module contains lists of attributions for the external audio-visual resources used throughout the course.",Free Online Course (Audit),In progress,English,"18th Mar, 2019",3-4 hours a week,4 weeks long,"[""Russell Sayers"","" Asim Jalis"",""Carl Leonard""]"

How does blockchain technology change the way we provide financial services, and how should blockchain technology be governed? Is FinTech creating risks in cybersecurity and how can technology help us prevent financial crimes? As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is developed and adopted, will human biases and prejudices be built into such mechanisms? And at a larger scope, should FinTech lead to a decentralized, democratized system of finance, or will existing institutions adopt FinTech strategies to cement their existing hold on the financial markets?Through discussing and attempting to answer these questions, you will understand better how the introduction of these technologies can benefit or harm society.

In particular, data collection, customer privacy, and transactional issues will be covered in this module. Cybersecurity & Crimes FinTech can make it easier and cheaper for banks to monitor and control financial transactions, thus reducing fraud and reducing bank costs.

The orientation will also help you obtain the technical skills required for the course.Module 1: Introduction to Machine LearningThis module provides the basis for the rest of the course by introducing the basic concepts behind machine learning, and, specifically, how to perform machine learning by using Python and the scikit learn machine learning module. First, you will learn how machine learning and artificial intelligence are disrupting businesses. Next, you will learn about the basic types of machine learning and how to leverage these algorithms in a Python script. Third, you will learn how linear regression can be considered a machine learning problem with parameters that must be determined computationally by minimizing a cost function. Finally, you will learn about neighbor-based algorithms, including the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, which can be used for both classification and regression tasks.Module 2: Fundamental AlgorithmsThis module introduces several of the most important machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machine. Of these three algorithms, the first, logistic regression, is a classification algorithm (despite its name). The other two, however, can be used for either classification or regression tasks. Thus, this module will dive deeper into the concept of machine classification, where algorithms learn from existing, labeled data to classify new, unseen data into specific categories; and, the concept of machine regression, where algorithms learn a model from data to make predictions for new, unseen data. While these algorithms all differ in their mathematical underpinnings, they are often used for classifying numerical, text, and image data or performing regression in a variety of domains. This module will also review different techniques for quantifying the performance of a classification and regression algorithms and how to deal with imbalanced training data.Module 3: Practical Concepts in Machine LearningThis module introduces several important and practical concepts in machine learning. First, you will learn about the challenges inherent in applying data analytics (and machine learning in particular) to real world data sets. This also introduces several methodologies that you may encounter in the future that dictate how to approach, tackle, and deploy data analytic solutions. Next, you will learn about a powerful technique to combine the predictions from many weak learners to make a better prediction via a process known as ensemble learning. Specifically, this module will introduce two of the most popular ensemble learning techniques: bagging and boosting and demonstrate how to employ them in a Python data analytics script. Finally, the concept of a machine learning pipeline is introduced, which encapsulates the process of creating, deploying, and reusing machine learning models. Module 4: Overfitting & RegularizationThis module introduces the concept of regularization, problems it can cause in machine learning analyses, and techniques to overcome it. First, the basic concept of overfitting is presented along with ways to identify its occurrence. Next, the technique of cross-validation is introduced, which can mitigate the likelihood that overfitting can occur. Next, the use of cross-validation to identify the optimal parameters for a machine learning algorithm trained on a given data set is presented. Finally, the concept of regularization, where an additional penalty term is applied when determining the best machine learning model parameters, is introduced and demonstrated for different regression and classification algorithms.Module 5: Fundamental Probabilistic AlgorithmsThis module starts by discussing practical machine learning workflows that are deployed in production environments, which emphasizes the big picture view of machine learning. Next this module introduces two additional fundamental algorithms: naive Bayes and Gaussian Processes. These algorithms both have foundations in probability theory but operate under very different assumptions. Naive Bayes is generally used for classification tasks, while Gaussian Processes are generally used for regression tasks. This module also discusses practical issues in constructing machine learning workflows.Module 6: Feature EngineeringThis module introduces an important concept in machine learning, the selection of the actual features that will be used by a machine learning algorithm. Along with data cleaning, this step in the data analytics process is extremely important, yet it is often overlooked as a method for improving the overall performance of an analysis. This module beings with a discussion of ethics in machine learning, in large part because the selection of features can have (sometimes) non-obvious impacts on the final performance of an algorithm. This can be important when machine learning is applied to data in a regulated industry or when the improper application of an algorithm might lead to discrimination. The rest of this module introduces different techniques for either selecting the best features in a data set, or the construction of new features from the existing set of features.Module 7: Introduction to ClusteringThis module introduces clustering, where data points are assigned to larger groups of points based on some specific property, such as spatial distance or the local density of points. While humans often find clusters visually with ease in given data sets, computationally the problem is more challenging. This module starts by exploring the basic ideas behind this unsupervised learning technique, as well as different areas in which clustering can be used by businesses. Next, one of the most popular clustering techniques, K-means, is introduced. Next the density-based DB-SCAN technique is introduced. This module concludes by introducing the mixture models technique for probabilistically assigning points to clusters.Module 8: Introduction to Anomaly DetectionThis module introduces the concept of an anomaly, or outlier, and different techniques for identifying these unusual data points. First, the general concept of an anomaly is discussed and demonstrated in the business community via the detection of fraud, which in general should be an anomaly when compared to normal customers or operations. Next, statistical techniques for identifying outliers are introduced, which often involve simple descriptive statistics that can highlight data that are sufficiently far from the norm for a given data set. Finally, machine learning techniques are reviewed that can either classify outliers or identify points in low density (or outside normal clusters) areas as potential outliers.",Free Online Course (Audit),In progress,English,"18th Mar, 2019",N/A,8 weeks long,"[""""]"

Its applications are ubiquitous throughout our society. Its applications range from solving Sudoku puzzles to arranging seating in a wedding banquet.  The same technology can schedule planes and their crews, coordinate the production of steel, and organize the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Good decisions on the use of scarce or expensive resources such as staffing and material resources also allow corporations to improve their profit by millions of dollars.  Similar problems also underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods.This course is intended for students who have completed Advanced Modelling for Discrete Optimization.  In this course, you will extend your understanding of how to solve challenging discrete optimization problems by learning more about the solving technologies that are used to solve them, and how a high-level model (written in MiniZinc) is transformed into a form that is executable by these underlying solvers. By better understanding the actual solving technology, you will both improve your modeling capabilities, and be able to choose the most appropriate solving technology to use.Watch the course promotional video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EiRsK-Rm08","Basic Constraint ProgrammingThis module starts by using an example to illustrate the basic machinery of Constraint Programming solvers, namely constraint propagation and search.  While domains represent possibilities for variables, constraints are actively used to reason about domains and can be encoded as domain propagators and bounds propagators.  You will learn how a propagation engine handles a set of propagators and coordinates the propagation of constraint information via variable domains.  You will also learn basic search, variable and value choices, and how propagation and search can be combined in a seamless and efficient manner.  Last but not least, this module describes how to program search in MiniZinc.Advanced Constraint ProgrammingIn this module, you will see how Branch and Bound search can solve optimization problems and how search strategies become even more important in such situations.  You will be exposed to advanced search strategies, including restart search and impact-based search.  The module also uncovers the inner workings of such global constraints as alldifferent and cumulative.Mixed Integer ProgrammingThis module starts by introducing linear programming and the Simplex algorithm for solving continuous linear optimization problems, before showing how the method can be incorporated into Branch and Bound search for solving Mixed Integer Programs.  Learn Gomory Cuts and the Branch and Cut method to see how they can speed up solving.Local SearchThis module takes you into the exciting realm of local search methods, which allow for efficient exploration of some otherwise large and complex search space.  You will learn the notion of states, moves and neighbourhoods, and how they are utilized in basic greedy search and steepest descent search in constrained search space.  Learn various methods of escaping from and avoiding local minima, including restarts, simulated annealing, tabu lists and discrete Lagrange Multipliers.  Last but not least, you will see how Large Neighbourhood Search treats finding the best neighbour in a large neighbourhood as a discrete optimization problem, which allows us to explore farther and search more efficiently.",Free Online Course (Audit),Upcoming,English,"25th Mar, 2019",6-12 hours a week,4 weeks long,"[""Prof. Jimmy Ho Man Lee"",""Prof. Peter James Stuckey""]"

It discusses behavioural equivalences and illustrate these in a number of examples and quizzes. This course explains labelled transition systems or automata to model behaviour for especially software controlled systems. An important question is when two behaviours represented by such automata are equal. The answer to this question is not at all straightforward, but the resulting equivalences are used as powerful tools to simplify complex behaviour. This allows us to exactly investigate and understand the behavioural properties of such systems precisely. Especially, in the combination with hiding of behaviour, equivalence reduction is a unique technique to obtain insight in the behaviour of systems, far more effective than simulation or testing. Using this insight we can make the models correct.

They study patterns of behavior to know what someone will prefer from among a collection of things he has never experienced. The technology behind recommender systems has evolved over the past 20 years into a rich collection of tools that enable the practitioner or researcher to develop effective recommenders. We will study the most important of those tools, including how they work, how to use them, how to evaluate them, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice.The algorithms we will study include content-based filtering, user-user collaborative filtering, item-item collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, and interactive critique-based recommenders. The approach will be hands-on, with six week projects, each of which will involve implementation and evaluation of some type of recommender.In addition to topical lectures, this course includes interviews and guest lectures with experts from both academia and industry.Beginning in February 2015, you will be able to earn a Verified Certificate by verifying your identity via a webcam and a government-issued ID. This option will provide formal recognition of your achievements in the course and includes the University of Minnesota logo. Before then, you can complete a “test run” of the exam. You can then re-take the exam after the Verified Certificate becomes available.

It includes a detailed taxonomy of the types of recommender systems, and also includes a detailed tour of Amazon.com’s recommenders.  There is an introductory assessment in the final lesson that leads you through exploring recommender systems on their own.Non-Personalized RecommendersThis module covers non-personalized recommender systems, including recommendation based on summary statistics and on product-association rules.  These recommenders, which are widely used in practice, include overall popularity (how many people like this?  what’s the average rating?) and product-to-product recommenders such as “people who bought this item also bought” recommenders.  There is an assessment at the end of the module that has you compute non-personalized recommendations.  Content-Based RecommendersThis module covers content-based recommender systems.  These systems build a profile of content preferences based on the content attributes associated with items the users has liked or disliked.  We’ll discuss common mechanisms for building and maintaining content preference profiles and have an assessment that has you complete hand computations of content profiles and recommendations.User-User Collaborative FilteringThis module covers user-user collaborative filtering recommender systems.  This classic method matches a user against other users with similar preferences and then combines the preferences of those “nearest neighbor” users to form predictions and recommendations.  We cover a number of tunings and variations on the algorithm, and have an assessment where you implement your own user-user CF recommender in a spreadsheet.  EvaluationThis module focuses on metrics and evaluation.  It introduces a variety of metric types, individual metrics, experimental techniques, and evaluation goals.  In many ways, it is at the heart of the course -- what’s the point in having lots of different algorithms if you can’t tell which is better in a situation?  The assessment at the end of this module takes you through a set of situations to test your understanding of effective evaluation.  Item BasedThis module introduces item-item collaborative filtering, an early innovation that improved run-time performance by computing relationships among items from user rating data.  We also look at the interesting case of unary implicit data (like it or don’t know) and have an assessment that has you compute item-item recommendations in a spreadsheet.Dimensionality ReductionThis module introduces matrix factorization recommendation algorithms, the class of algorithms that seems to be among the most promising today for good recommendation quality and scalability.  We introduce you to the concepts behind these algorithms, some specific implementations, and a look at current directions.  Your last assessment in the course involves computing predictions and recommendations from factored-matrix representations of ratings matrices.

Text data are unique in that they are usually generated directly by humans rather than a computer system or sensors, and are thus especially valuable for discovering knowledge about people’s opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. This course will cover search engine technologies, which play an important role in any data mining applications involving text data for two reasons. First, while the raw data may be large for any particular problem, it is often a relatively small subset of the data that are relevant, and a search engine is an essential tool for quickly discovering a small subset of relevant text data in a large text collection. Second, search engines are needed to help analysts interpret any patterns discovered in the data by allowing them to examine the relevant original text data to make sense of any discovered pattern. You will learn the basic concepts, principles, and the major techniques in text retrieval, which is the underlying science of search engines.","OrientationYou will become familiar with the course, your classmates, and our learning environment. The orientation will also help you obtain the technical skills required for the course.Week 1During this week's lessons, you will learn of natural language processing techniques, which are the foundation for all kinds of text-processing applications, the concept of a retrieval model, and the basic idea of the vector space model. Week 2In this week's lessons, you will learn how the vector space model works in detail, the major heuristics used in designing a retrieval function for ranking documents with respect to a query, and how to implement an information retrieval system (i.e., a search engine), including how to build an inverted index and how to score documents quickly for a query. Week 3In this week's lessons, you will learn how to evaluate an information retrieval system (a search engine), including the basic measures for evaluating a set of retrieved results and the major measures for evaluating a ranked list, including the average precision (AP) and the normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG), and practical issues in evaluation, including statistical significance testing and pooling.Week 4In this week's lessons, you will learn probabilistic retrieval models and statistical language models, particularly the detail of the query likelihood retrieval function with two specific smoothing methods, and how the query likelihood retrieval function is connected with the retrieval heuristics used in the vector space model. Week 5In this week's lessons, you will learn feedback techniques in information retrieval, including the Rocchio feedback method for the vector space model, and a mixture model for feedback with language models.

You'll learn how to store data securely on a device using Core Data.  You’ll also learn to securely deploy apps to the App Store and beta users over-the-air.The format of the course is through a series of code tutorials.  We will walk you through the creation of several apps that you can keep as a personal app toolbox.  When you make your own apps after this course, you can bring in these capabilities as needed.  When necessary we pop out of the code tutorials to talk about concepts at a higher level so that what you are programming makes sense.Upon completing this course, you will be able to:1.       Post Facebook, Twitter, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo messages to social media using single sign-on on behalf of a user.2.

Our focus in this course is very practitioner oriented.  We want to get you up and running using social networking integration with single sign-on, basic OAuth2 functionality, secure JSON web APIs, cryptographically secured push notifications, and secure data storage so that you can get apps into the iTunes ecosystem and out into the marketplace.  This course will have several code sessions in which we walk you through the process of building apps, some of which you will also build for peer review assignments.  Interspersed with the tutorials we will take time-outs to cover the basics of some concepts that might be mysterious without a more formal treatment.   Our hope is that you come out of this course knowing more (of course!) and having several projects that you can refer to in the future when you want to incorporate these techniques into your apps - your personal app toolbox.  The intensity picks up from the previous course in this Specialization, so get ready!Using Secure Web APIs: an Instagram Case StudyNow it's time to consider what we are going to do if we want to work with web services that aren't deeply integrated into iOS.  There are hundreds (thousands?!?!) of them.   Most of them require authentication via the OAuth 2.0 protocol.  In this week's lessons we will walk through an example of getting a photo from Instagram on behalf of a user.   This week is also a code tutorial in preparation for your peer review assignment, but in the middle we need to step back from coding to cover some basics:  How do we use a UIImageView?  What is OAuth 2.0 anyway?  What is JSON and how do we read it? What's the big deal about http vs https anyway?Don't be so pushy!In this week we will look at several aspects of push notifications.   Those are those alerts that show up at the top of your iOS interface when an app wants to get your attention.   There are several ways that they can be initiated.  They can be initiated from an app on a local device, or they can be initiated by a remote server somewhere on the internet.  Obtaining permission to post those notifications requires lots of steps, certificates, passwords etc.   We'll walk you through it all.   This week we start with a high-level overview of the iOS app lifecycle.  Then we will do three code tutorials.  The first will be the one that you will need to do the peer-review assessment.  It's a basic countdown timer that sends a notification at a specific time.  The second will show you how to make it all fancy with custom actions.  The final one will be for remote notifications.  Since remote notifications require an Apple developer account ($$$) we won't assess you on it, but if you have one you can try it out on your own and add it to your personal app toolbox.Storing DataIn this week we look at method of securely storing data on the iOS platform called Core Data.",Free Online Course (Audit),Upcoming,English,"25th Mar, 2019",5-7 hours a week,4 weeks long,"[""Don Patterson"",""Sam Kaufman""]"

Understand data analysis via EDA as a journey and a way to explore data  Explore data at multiple levels using appropriate visualizations  Acquire statistical knowledge for summarizing data  Demonstrate curiosity and skepticism when performing data analysis  Develop intuition around a data set and understand how the data was generated.","Lesson 1: What is EDA? (1 hour)We'll start by learn about what exploratory data analysis (EDA) is and why it is important. You'll meet the amazing instructors for the course and find out about the course structure and final project.Lesson 2: R Basics (3 hours)EDA, which comes before formal hypothesis testing and modeling, makes use of visual methods to analyze and summarize data sets. R will be our tool for generating those visuals and conducting analyses. In this lesson, we will install RStudio and packages, learn the layout and basic commands of R, practice writing basic R scripts, and inspect data sets.Lesson 3: Explore One Variable (4 hours)We perform EDA to understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers. Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set as we begin to make sense of a pseudo-data set of Facebook users. While the data set does not contain real user data, it does contain a wealth of information. Through the lesson, we will create histograms and boxplots, transform variables, and examine tradeoffs in visualizations.Problem Set 3 (2 hours)Lesson 4: Explore Two Variables (4 hours)EDA allows us to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models. In this lesson, we will learn techniques for exploring the relationship between any two variables in a data set. We'll create scatter plots, calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means.Problem Set 4 (2 hours)Lesson 5: Explore Many Variables (4 hours)Data sets can be complex. In this lesson, we will learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables. We'll learn how to reshape data frames and how to use aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information. Extending our knowledge of previous plots, we'll continue to build intuition around the Facebook data set and explore some new data sets as well.Problem Set 5 (2 hours)Lesson 6: Diamonds and Price Predictions (2 hours)Investigate the diamonds data set alongside Facebook Data Scientist, Solomon Messing. He'll recap many of the strategies covered in the course and show how predictive modeling can allow us to determine a good price for a diamond. As a final project, you will create your own exploratory data analysis on a data set of your choice.Final Project (10+ hours)You've explored simulated Facebook user data and the diamonds data set. Now, it's your turn to conduct your own exploratory data analysis. Choose one data set to explore (one provided by Udacity or your own) and create a RMD file that uncovers the patterns, anomalies and relationships of the data set.",Free Online Course,Self Paced,English,Self paced,N/A,8 weeks long,"[""Moira Burke"",""Dean Eckles""]"

It was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history, caused by a mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Soon, German officials linked the outbreak to a restaurant in Lübeck, where nearly 20% of the patrons had developed bloody diarrhea in a single week. At this point, biologists knew that they were facing a previously unknown pathogen and that traditional methods would not suffice – computational biologists would be needed to assemble and analyze the genome of the newly emerged pathogen.To investigate the evolutionary origin and pathogenic potential of the outbreak strain, researchers started a crowdsourced research program. They released bacterial DNA sequencing data from one of a patient, which elicited a burst of analyses carried out by computational biologists on four continents. They even used GitHub for the project: https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wikiThe 2011 German outbreak represented an early example of epidemiologists collaborating with computational biologists to stop an outbreak.

It was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history, caused by a mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Within a few months, the outbreak had infected thousands and killed 53 people. To prevent the further spread of the outbreak, computational biologists all over the world had to answer the question “What is the genome sequence of E. coli X?” in order to figure out what new genes it acquired to become pathogenic. The 2011 German outbreak represented an early example of epidemiologists collaborating with computational biologists to stop an outbreak. In this Genome Assembly Programming Challenge, you will follow in the footsteps of the bioinformaticians investigating the outbreak by developing a program to assemble the genome of the deadly E. coli X strain.

By the late 1980s, biologists were routinely sequencing viral genomes containing hundreds of thousands of nucleotides, but the idea of sequencing a bacterial (let alone the human) genome containing millions (or even billions) of nucleotides remained preposterous and would cost billions of dollars.In 1988, three biologists (independently and simultaneously!) came up with an idea to reduce sequencing cost and proposed the futuristic and at the time completely implausible method of DNA arrays. None of these three biologists could have possibly imagined that the implications of his own experimental research would eventually bring him face-to-face with challenging algorithmic problems. In this module you will learn about the algorithmic challenge of DNA sequencing using information about short k-mers provided by DNA arrays. You will also travel to the 18the century to learn about the Bridges of Konigsberg and solve a related problem of assembling a jigsaw puzzle!Genome Assembly Faces Real Sequencing DataOur discussion of genome assembly has thus far relied upon various assumptions. In this module, we will face practical challenges introduced by quirks in modern sequencing technologies and discuss some algorithmic techniques that have been devised to address these challenges.

If you want to acquire deep-learning skills but lack the time, I feel your pain.In university, I had a math teacher who would yell at me, “Mr. Görner, integrals are taught in kindergarten!” I get the same feeling today, when I read most free online resources dedicated to deep learning. My kindergarten education was apparently severely lacking in “dropout lullabies,” “cross-entropy riddles,” and“relu-gru-rnn-lstmmonster stories.” Yet, these fundamental concepts are taken for granted by many, if not most, authors of online educational resources about deep learning.To help more developers embrace deep-learning techniques, without the need to earn a Ph.D., I have attempted to flatten the learning curve by building a short crash-course (3 hours total). The course is focused on a few basic network architectures, including dense, convolutional and recurrent networks, and training techniques such as dropout or batch normalization. (This course was initially presented at theDevoxx conferencein Antwerp, Belgium, in November 2016.) By watching the recordings of the course and viewing the annotated slides, you can learn how to solve a couple of typical problems with neural networks and also pick up enough vocabulary and concepts to continue your deep learning self-education—for example, by exploringTensorFlowresources.

What are some examples of data science projects?  Relational Databases and the Relational AlgebraRelational Databases are the workhouse of large-scale data management.  Although originally motivated by problems in enterprise operations, they have proven remarkably capable for analytics as well.  But most importantly, the principles underlying relational databases are universal in managing, manipulating, and analyzing data at scale.

For working with large-scale data, there is no more important programming model to learn.MapReduce and Parallel Dataflow ProgrammingThe MapReduce programming model (as distinct from its implementations) was proposed as a simplifying abstraction for parallel manipulation of massive datasets, and remains an important concept to know when using and evaluating modern big data platforms.  NoSQL: Systems and ConceptsNoSQL systems are purely about scale rather than analytics, and are arguably less relevant for the practicing data scientist.  However, they occupy an important place in many practical big data platform architectures, and data scientists need to understand their limitations and strengths to use them effectively.Graph AnalyticsGraph-structured data are increasingly common in data science contexts due to their ubiquity in modeling the communication between entities: people (social networks), computers (Internet communication), cities and countries (transportation networks), or corporations (financial transactions).

Computational Geometry is now considered the basis of robotics, computer aided design and manufacturing (CAM and CID), and geographic information systems (GIS).众所周知，几何学的历史至少可追述至古希腊时代，但不同人对“计算几何”的理解却不尽相同。本课程讨论的计算几何，源自于古典离散/组合几何学与现代计算机科学的结合。M. I. Shamos在1978年完成的博士论文，标志着这个学科分支的诞生。从那时起，“计算几何”往往特指针对离散与组合几何结构的算法研究。简而言之，她也可认为是算法设计与分析的几何版。  本课程的教学目标有三：  其一、对计算几何理论的总体认识，在日后的研究工作中，这种认识为你提供几何的视角其次、对几何问题求解范式及策略的全面领会，包括递增式构造、平面扫描、分而治之、分层化、近似以及随机化等最后、对基本几何结构及其算法的透彻掌握，包括凸包、多边形细分、Voronoi图、Delaunay三角剖分，以及几何求交、点定位、范围查找、截窗查询等",N/A,Free Online Course (Audit),In progress,English,"20th Feb, 2019",6-8 hours a week,16 weeks long,"[""Junhui Deng""]"

And more importantly - you will learn how to harness the power of App Engine - Platform as a Service, run by Google, so you can focus on your application's features, not on managing infrastructure that runs your app. Let Google run and scale the infrastructure and do what you do best - write code! However, to use App Engine effectively, you have to learn how it works, and this is exactly what this course will teach! You will also learn the best practices of using Cloud Endpoints that allow you to easily create RESTful services and make them accessible to iOS, Android and Javascript clients. They allow you to automatically generate client libraries to make wiring up the frontend easy. And there are some nifty built-in features, like denial-of-service protection and OAuth 2.0 support.Why Take This Course?Cloud computing is one of the fastest growing fields right now. And no wonder - it provides an easy and affordable way to run your applications. However, the traditional way of hosting and scaling applications on Virtual Machines in the Cloud comes with a cost - even if the infrastructure is virtual, you still have to manage it - do load balancing, bring instances up and down, take care of patching your software and in general spend a lot of your time and resources on just the infrastructure. Google is one of the pioneers in the business of scaling, and now you can use their infrastructure, and let them do all the scaling work so that you can focus on the unique features your app provides.Are you a Python developer? If so, maybe you'd like to check out our Developing Scalable Apps in Python course.ProjectThere will be an overarching project throughout the course, starting from Lesson 2. You will develop an application for organizing conferences, similar to sites like meetup.com or eventbrite.com. We have provided the frontend of the app, and all your effort will go into making the backend.And because you will be using Cloud Endpoints, it’s really easy to hook up your backend with a native mobile app. We have created an Android app that uses the same backend as the web frontend. You will able to recompile it against your backend, if you so wish!At the end of the course you will do a final project, where you will have to expand the functionality of the same app.","OverviewThis course consists of 6 lessons. First one is an overview of cloud computing and the benefits of Platform as a Service. Lessons 2-5 will cover important theoretical concepts of Google App Engine and also plenty of hands-on exercises implementing what you have learned. Lesson 6 will be a short intro on an easy way to create native mobile apps that talk to your backend.Lesson 1: Scalability BasicsDo you know how and why server racks were invented years ago? Have you realized all of the problems that you have to solve if you will try to scale your app by yourself? Learn about a better way.Lesson 2: Getting StartedSet up your first App Engine project and learn how to define Cloud Endpoints. Start the course project app - Conference Central and add authentication and user profiles.Lesson 3: Storing and Retrieving DataOne of the most important things you want to do in your app is storing data. In this lesson you will learn what is Google App Engine Datastore, how is it different from RDBMS and how you can use it in your applications.Add the ability to store and retrieve user profiles and conferences to the course project app.Lesson 4: Advanced Datastore ConceptsLearn more about how Datastore works, including queries, filters, indexes and transactions. Add different ways to query conferences.Lesson 5: Advanced App Engine TopicsThere are a lot of things you might want your application to do in background, without making the user wait, or even initiate the process. Learn about task queues and cron jobs and how you can use them to add advanced functionality to your app. You will also learn about Memcache, and get an overview of topics like Edge Caching, AppStats and other methods of optimising your apps performance.Add a push queue, cron job and a customised Memcache entry to your app.Lesson 6: App Engine and Mobile AppsYou have been using Cloud Endpoints in the app, and now it’s time to see how you can use them in a mobile app. Learn how to generate native libraries for Android and iOS that can talk to your backend.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-cyber-security-economics-2680,Cyber Security Economics,Delft University of Technology,edX,Cybersecurity,,"This economics course provides an introduction to the field of cybersecurity through the lens of economic principles. Delivered by four leading research teams, it will provide you with the economic concepts, measurement approaches and data analytics to make better security and IT decisions, as well as understand the forces that shape the security decisions of other actors in the ecosystem of information goods and services.Systems often fail because the organizations that defend them do not bear the full costs of failure. In order to solve the problems of growing vulnerability to computer hackers and increasing crime, solutions must coherently allocate responsibilities and liabilities so that the parties in a position to fix problems have an incentive to do so. This requires a technical comprehension of security threats combined with an economic perspective to uncover the strategies employed by cyber hackers, attackers and defenders.The course covers five main areas:	Introduction to key concepts in security economics. Here, we provide an overview of how information security is shaped by economic mechanisms, such as misaligned incentives, information asymmetry, and externalities.	Measuring cybersecurity. We introduce state of the art security and IT metrics and conceptualize the characteristics of a security metric, its challenges and advantages.	Economics of information security investment. We discuss and apply different economic models that help determine the costs and benefits of security investments in network security.	Security market failures. We discuss market failures that may lead to cybersecurity investment levels that are insufficient from society’s perspective and other forms of unsafe behaviour in cyber space.	Behavioural economics for information security, policy and regulation. We discuss available economic tools to better align the incentives for cybersecurity, including better security metrics, cyber insurance/risk transfer, information sharing, and liability assignment.After finishing this course, you will be able to apply economic analysis and data analytics to cybersecurity. You will understand the role played by incentives on the adoption and effectiveness of security mechanisms, and on the design of technical, market-based, and regulatory solutions to different security threats.LICENSEThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.",N/A,Free Online Course (Audit),Self Paced,English,Self paced,2-4 hours a week,10 weeks long,"[""""]"

https://www.classcentral.com/course/udacity-intro-to-machine-learning-2996,Regression Modeling in Practice,Wesleyan University,Coursera,Artificial Intelligence,,"This course focuses on one of the most important tools in your data analysis arsenal: regression analysis. Using either SAS or Python, you will begin with linear regression and then learn how to adapt when two variables do not present a clear linear relationship. You will examine multiple predictors of your outcome and be able to identify confounding variables, which can tell a more compelling story about your results. You will learn the assumptions underlying regression analysis, how to interpret regression coefficients, and how to use regression diagnostic plots and other tools to evaluate the quality of your regression model. Throughout the course, you will share with others the regression models you have developed and the stories they tell you.","Introduction to RegressionThis session starts where the Data Analysis Tools course left off. This first set of videos provides you with some conceptual background about the major types of data you may work with, which will increase your competence in choosing the statistical analysis that’s most appropriate given the structure of your data, and in understanding the limitations of your data set. We also introduce you to the concept of confounding variables, which are variables that may be the reason for the association between your explanatory and response variable. Finally, you will gain experience in describing your data by writing about your sample, the study data collection procedures, and your measures and data management steps. Basics of Linear RegressionIn this session, we discuss more about the importance of testing for confounding, and provide examples of situations in which a confounding variable can explain the association between an explanatory and response variable. In addition, now that you have statistically tested the association between an explanatory variable and your response variable, you will test and interpret this association using basic linear regression analysis for a quantitative response variable. You will also learn about how the linear regression model can be used to predict your observed response variable. Finally, we will also discuss the statistical assumptions underlying the linear regression model, and show you some best practices for coding your explanatory variablesNote that if your research question does not include one quantitative response variable, you can use one from your data set just to get some practice with the tool. Multiple RegressionMultiple regression analysis is tool that allows you to expand on your research question, and conduct a more rigorous test of the association between your explanatory and response variable by adding additional quantitative and/or categorical explanatory variables to your linear regression model. In this session, you will apply and interpret a multiple regression analysis for a quantitative response variable, and will learn how to use confidence intervals to take into account error in estimating a population parameter. You will also learn how to account for nonlinear associations in a linear regression model. Finally, you will develop experience using regression diagnostic techniques to evaluate how well your multiple regression model predicts your observed response variable. Note that if you have not yet identified additional explanatory variables, you should choose at least one additional explanatory variable from your data set. When you go back to your codebooks, ask yourself a few questions like “What other variables might explain the association between my explanatory and response variable?”; “What other variables might explain more of the variability in my response variable?”, or even “What other explanatory variables might be interesting to explore?” Additional explanatory variables can be either quantitative, categorical, or both. Although you need only two explanatory variables to test a multiple regression model, we encourage you to identify more than one additional explanatory variable. Doing so will really allow you to experience the power of multiple regression analysis, and will increase your confidence in your ability to test and interpret more complex regression models. If your research question does not include one quantitative response variable, you can use the same quantitative response variable that you used in Module 2, or you may choose another one from your data set. Logistic RegressionIn this session, we will discuss some things that you should keep in mind as you continue to use data analysis in the future. We will also teach also you how to test a categorical explanatory variable with more than two categories in a multiple regression analysis. Finally, we introduce you to logistic regression analysis for a binary response variable with multiple explanatory variables. Logistic regression is simply another form of the linear regression model, so the basic idea is the same as a multiple regression analysis. But, unlike the multiple regression model, the logistic regression model is designed to test binary response variables. You will gain experience testing and interpreting a logistic regression model, including using odds ratios and confidence intervals to determine the magnitude of the association between your explanatory variables and response variable.   You can use the same explanatory variables that you used to test your multiple regression model with a quantitative outcome, but your response variable needs to be binary (categorical with 2 categories). If you have a quantitative response variable, you will have to bin it into 2 categories. Alternatively, you can choose a different binary response variable from your data set that you can use to test a logistic regression model. If you have a categorical response variable with more than two categories, you will need to collapse it into two categories.",Free Online Course (Audit),Upcoming,English,"22nd Mar, 2019",N/A,4 weeks long,"[""Sebastian Thrun""]"

Spatial DBMS and Big Data SystemsThe fourth module is entitled to ""Spatial DBMS and Big Data Systems"", which covers two disciplines related to spatial data science, and will make learners understand how to use DBMS and Big Data Systems to manage spatial data and spatial big data.  This module is composed of six lectures.  The first two lectures will cover DBMS and Spatial DBMS, and the rest of the lectures will cover Big Data Systems.  The first lecture ""Database Management System (DBMS)"" will introduce powerful functionalities of DBMS and related features, and limitations of conventional Relational DBMS for spatial data.  The second lecture ""Spatial DBMS"" focuses on the difference of spatial DBMS from conventional DBMS, and new features to manage spatial data.  The third lecture will give learners a brief overview of Big Data Systems and the current paradigm - MapReduce.  The fourth lecture will cover Hadoop MapReduce, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Hadoop YARN, as an implementation of MapReduce paradigm, and also will present the first example of spatial big data processing using Hadoop MapReduce. The fifth lecture will introduce Hadoop ecosystem and show how to utilize Hadoop tools such as Hive, Pig, Sqoop, and HBase for spatial big data processing.  The last lecture ""Spatial Big Data System"" will introduce two Hadoop tools for spatial big data - Spatial Hadoop and GIS Tools for Hadoop, and review their pros and cons for spatial big data management and processing. Spatial Data Analytics The fifth module is entitled to ""Spatial Data Analytics"", which is one of the four disciplines related to spatial data science.  Spatial Data Analytics could cover a wide spectrum of spatial analysis methods, however, in this module, only some portion of spatial data analysis methods will be covered.  The first lecture is an introduction, in which an overview of Spatial Data Analytics and a list of six topics are given and discussed.  The second lecture ""Proximity and Accessibility"" will make learners realize how spatial data science can be used for business applications, while trade area analysis, supply to demand ratio, Floating Catchment Analysis (FCA), and Gravity-based index of accessibility are introduced and applied to real world problems. The third lecture ""Spatial Autocorrelation"" will give an instruction on how to measure spatial autocorrelation and to apply hypothesis test with Moran's I.  The fourth lecture ""Spatial Interpolation"" will introduce trend surface analysis, inverse distance weighting, and Kriging. Particularly, in-depth explanations regarding Kriging, a de facto standard of spatial interpolation will be presented.  The fifth lecture ""Spatial Categorization"" will make learners understand classification algorithms such as Minimum Distance to Mean (MDM) and Decision Tree (DT), clustering algorithms such as K-Means and DBSCAN with real-world examples.  The sixth lecture ""Hotspot Analysis"" will introduce hotspot analysis and Getis-Ord GI* as the most popular method.  The seventh lecture ""Network Analysis"" will make learners explore the algorithms of geocoding, map matching, and shortest path finding, of which importance is increasing in spatial big data analysis.Practical Applications of Spatial Data ScienceThe sixth module is entitled to ""Practical Applications of Spatial Data Science"", in which five real-world problems are introduced and corresponding solutions are presented with step-by-step procedures in the solution structures and related open source software's, discussed in Module 2.  The first lecture presents an example of Desktop GIS, in which only QGIS is used,  to find the top 5 counties for timberland investment in the southeastern states of the U.S, in which simple differencing of demand and supply is applied to figure out counties of large deficit of timber supply in comparison with timber demand.  In the second lecture, an example of sever GIS, in which QGIS and PostgreSQL/PostGIS are used, will be presented as a solution for a given problem of NYC spatial data center, which required multiple user access and different levels of privileges.  The third lecture presents an example of spatial data analytics, in which QGIS and R are used, to find out any regional factors which contribute to higher or lower disease prevalence in administrative districts, for which spatial autocorrelation analysis is conducted and decision tree analysis is applied.  The fourth lecture is another example of spatial data analytics, to find optimal infiltration routing with network analysis, in which cost surface is produced and Dijkstra's algorithm is used.  The fifth lecture is an example of spatial big data management and analytics, in which QGIS, PostGIS, R, and Hadoop MapReduce are all used, to provide a solution of ""Passenger Finder"", which can guide to the places where more passengers are waiting for taxi cabs.  For the solution, spatial big data, taxi trajectory, are collected, and noise removal and map matching are conducted in Hadoop environment.  Then, a series of spatial data processing and analysis such as spatial join in PostGIS, hotspot analysis in R are conducted in order to provide the solution.  All in all, learners will realize the value of spatial big data and power of the solution structure with combination of four disciplines.",Free Online Course (Audit),Upcoming,English,"1st Apr, 2019",N/A,6 weeks long,"[""Sebastian Thrun"",""Peter Norvig""]"

We cover the basic components of deep learning, what it means, how it works, and develop code necessary to build various algorithms such as deep convolutional networks, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and recurrent neural networks. A major focus of this course will be to not only understand how to build the necessary components of these algorithms, but also how to apply them for exploring creative applications. We'll see how to train a computer to recognize objects in an image and use this knowledge to drive new and interesting behaviors, from understanding the similarities and differences in large datasets and using them to self-organize, to understanding how to infinitely generate entirely new content or match the aesthetics or contents of another image. Deep learning offers enormous potential for creative applications and in this course we interrogate what's possible. Through practical applications and guided homework assignments, you'll be expected to create datasets, develop and train neural networks, explore your own media collections using existing state-of-the-art deep nets, synthesize new content from generative algorithms, and understand deep learning's potential for creating entirely new aesthetics and new ways of interacting with large amounts of data.","Session 1:Introduction To TensorflowWe'll cover the importance of data with machine and deep learning algorithms, the basics of creating a dataset, how to preprocess datasets, then jump into Tensorflow, a library for creating computational graphs built by Google Research.

We'll then build our first neural network and use it for a fun application of teaching a neural network how to paint an image.Session 3:Unsupervised And Supervised LearningThis session goes deep. We create deep neural networks capable of encoding a large dataset, and see how we can use this encoding to explore ""latent"" dimensions of a dataset or for generating entirely new content. We'll see what this means, how ""autoencoders"" can be built, and learn a lot of state-of-the-art extensions that make them incredibly powerful. We'll also learn about another type of model that performs discriminative learning and see how this can be used to predict labels of an image.Session 4:Visualizing And Hallucinating RepresentationsThis sessions works with state of the art networks and sees how to understand what ""representations"" they learn. We'll see how this process actually allows us to perform some really fun visualizations including ""Deep Dream"" which can produce infinite generative fractals, or ""Style Net"" which allows us to combine the content of one image and the style of another to produce widely different painterly aesthetics automatically.Session 5:Generative ModelsThe last session offers a teaser into some of the future directions of generative modeling, including some state of the art models such as the ""generative adversarial network"", and its implementation within a ""variational autoencoder"", which allows for some of the best encodings and generative modeling of datasets that currently exist.

https://www.classcentral.com/course/coursera-capstone-photo-tourist-web-application-5123,Capstone: Photo Tourist Web Application,Johns Hopkins University,Coursera,Web Development,,"In this Capstone project for the Photo Tourist you will implement a Ruby on Rails web application that makes use of both a relational and NoSQL database for the backend and expose the data through services to the Internet using Web services and a responsive user interface operating in a browser from a desktop and mobile device. You will have a chance to revisit and apply what you have learned in our previous courses to build and deploy a fully functional web application to the cloud accessible to your co-workers, future employers, friends, and family.In developing the Photo Tourist web application, you will get to work with different data types and data access scenarios (e.g., fielded data display and update, image upload/download, text search, access controlled information) to provide your users the ability to show off their photos and information from trips they have taken and to seek out photos and information from trips taken by others. Using the application you develop, your users will be able to•	Create an account•	Upload and download photos to the site and make them accessible to others•	Provide descriptions of trips and photos that others can read•	Organize photos by location and trip, •	Find photos based on location•	Find photos based on text searches of descriptions •	Locate the place where the photo was taken on a map","Technical Architecture and API Development SetupIn this module, we will start your journey into being part of an end-to-end application development as a Rails/AngularJS fullstack developer intern. You will learn the technical architecture and software requirements of the targeted application you will be a part of developing. You will also get a chance to shake off any rust that may have accumulated on your Rails development skills. As a part of the technical architecture, you will learn of the various layers, technologies, libraries, and services used in the development, deployment, and operation of the targeted application. You will get an early sense that this course is ""no joke"" when it comes to challenges, but you will be shown a path through most of them. You may be able to skip the application installation until the end if you are using the same computer that you used in the first five (5) courses of the specialization. None of the new software installations are required for this module -- but are included in a single lesson for modularity. You will develop an end-to-end, API-to-Database, resource solution for ActiveRecord/RDBMS and Mongoid/MongoDB using Rails scaffold generator. You will establish a Git repository for this work, provision database and Rails resources on the internet for staging and production deployments, and deploy your solution to the Heroku to be accessible from the Internet. If you are a seasoned Rails developer and competent with ActiveRecord, Mongoid, and Heroku -- you may want to initially skip the review lectures, review the final Git commit for module one (1), and try your hand at the optional assignment at the end.  Aside from the technical architecture lesson, this module is mostly a quick breeze through many of the topics of courses one (1) through three (3).  A similar, small-scale review of courses four (4) through five (5) will be covered in the next module. Please enjoy! Also, if you have not done so already I recommend that you read the Course Overview description which provides additional context on what you will be doing in this course. To access, please click the Resources tab on the left navigation. SPA Development SetupIn this module, you will develop an AngularJS web application for the purposes of managing a resource hosted by a Rails server. As a part of that, you will learn the details of the Rails Asset Pipeline for hosting web applications, key features to address when moving from development to production, and different deployment options that you have within this course. You will complete an end-to-end AngularJS/Rails application to manage the resource on the Rails server you developed and deployed as a part of module one (1). This application will consist of AngularJS 1.x, UI-Router, and ngResource modules as well as a sample service, directive, controller, and web page to manage the resource. You will learn the details of the Rails Asset Pipeline as an option for deploying web assets like AngularJS web applications and what features it provides and how to conform to its conventions to get those features. Novice and intermediate developers are encouraged to use the Asset Pipeline approach in this module and throughout the course for simplicity and consistency with the examples in follow-on modules as this will be the development approach used by all follow-on modules. You will optionally learn how to leverage node package manager, bower, and gulp to establish an external development environment that parallels many of the capabilities provided by Asset Pipeline (e.g., minification to reduce bandwidth requirements and concatenation to reduce the number of separate server HTTP connections). You may leverage this environment to form a deployment to Github, like performed during courses four (4) and five (5) except with deployment considerations addressed. Although there is a functional gulpfile developed during the module, you are encouraged to treat this as an optional topic. Additionally, you can optionally learn how to use a hybrid of external development and Rails by using Rails as a web server and deploying your web application to the public directory and forming a single development tree and deployment artifact to Heroku. Like the pure external development approach, you are encouraged to treat this approach as an optional topic.  TestingIn this module, you will learn how to development model, request, and feature specs using RSpec and to leverage gems like DatabaseCleaner, FactoryGirl, and Faker in building those specs. You will also learn how to DRY their tests using RSpec shared_contexts and shared_examples as well as Ruby modules for helper methods. All use of tests within the capstone will be ""integration-style"" tests, going to the database and back. We will not have time to implement pure unit tests for individual components. For model testing, we will focus tests on factories, query scopes, relationships, and facade methods interacting directly with PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases. We will address the general purpose and custom techniques for managing the database state during cleanup. For API testing, we will form a hefty set of RSpec shared_contexts and Ruby helper methods for the request specs that will take care of the details of many CRUD behaviors and other tedious, repetitive tasks. The API is not only easier to test than the Web UI, it is a first-class external interface deserving of separate testing. During test coverage, you will learn internal Rails error handling techniques that will provide the web client a proper and sane web reply in the face of errors. For Web UI testing, we will introduce Capybara for building feature tests and the role of the RackTest, Selenium, and Poltergeist/PhantomJS drivers for implementing UI testing with Javascript. Although Capybara provides a nice interface for expressing Web UI tests, the asynchronous nature of Web UIs make them extremely difficult to test without well thought out decisions during development.  This course has a special emphasis on teaching you how to develop automated integration tests at all levels of the architecture, including the Web UIs. It is recommended that you review this module and sample further test-related lectures in follow-on modules to get a good understanding of how testing can best be leveraged in a full stack development (within constraints of the course). Except for the seasoned RSpec and Capybara user, there is no shortcut through this module.Security and the Photo Tourist Domain ModelIn this module, you will learn how to implement authenticated interfaces providing role-based authorization required to protect web resources. You will also practice these techniques while implementing the core resources for the Photo Tourist application. You will learn how to manage user accounts with the Devise Ruby gem and how to implement token-based authentication with the devise_token_auth Ruby gem and ng-token-auth AngularJS module. With this starting point -- the student is on a straightforward path to implementing external authentication (e.g., via Facebook, Twitter, Github) through OAuth2 (not part of the capstone). Additionally, how to implement end-to-end account registration from the UI, through the API, to Devise through the intermediate libraries and implement an authenticated session component in Angular and make that available through a Navbar based on a Bootstrap implementation. You will learn how to add role-based security to their resources with the aid of the Pundit Ruby gem to determine access not only on authentication -- but also on assigned roles for the anonymous and authenticated user. The content and code-along exercises provide opportunities to implement role-based access checks within the Web UI to help guide a user to making authorized choices appropriate for their assigned roles. And how to write optimized SQL queries to implement compound, custom resource payloads for efficient expression of related object information -- including mapping roles to resources accessed by specific users. ************* This is a very long module with very important material relative to security and the targeted application. It will likely be broken up into two (2) or more modules in the future. You should budget extra time for this and treat it as if it were two (2) modules for the amount of time spent. Yes -- that means the novice developer could spend upwards to forty-eight (48) hours going through the lectures, performing the optional code-alongs, and completing the mandatory assignment. *************. The mandatory assignment for this module will be posted shortly after the last lectures are posted and there is a Git commit available in Github for that lecture.Image ContentIn this module, you will implement image content within the end-to-end application.  At the data tier, you will use the BSON::Binary type to store binary data within MongoDB, manipulate image sizes and content using ImageMagick/MiniMagick, implement model validation and content size queries using Mongoid.  At the API tier, you will implement content size queries and web caching of write-once, read-many content using a custom HTTP ETag and Cache-Control headers.  Within the UI, you will  load, manage, edit, and upload new content using AngularJS, ng-file-upload, and ui-cropper modules. You will also implement a re-usable component to vview full size images with embedded information and controls that allow you to cycle through a series of images.GeolocationIn this module you will add geolocation capabilities to the end-to-end application. This will allow your users to assign a geolocation position to images as well as identify the current origin and distance limits for future API queries. You will implement the model and API queries for subjects within this module and complete the UI components within the next module. At the data tier you will add geolocation coordinates to the Image model, make those geolocation coordinates available to ThingImage though the 1:1 relationship between them, implement geolocation queries using the Geokit Rails gem that determine all items within a distance limit from an origin and supply their distance from origin. These queries will leverage custom SQL selects, joins (inner, right outer, and left outer join) and will be encapsulated within ActiveModel query scopes. At the API tier you will implement API service endpoints to geocode addresses and reverse geocode positions into a resolved location using the Geokit Rails gem and the Google Maps Geocode service,  implement a persistence cache of geocode results using MongoDB to help stay within free service limits and speed up lookups, enable an API service endpoint to query for subjects (ThingImages) of a certain type, within a distance limit, and dynamically annotate them with the distance from the supplied origin, implement HTTP caching headers for both geocode and subject results. At the UI tier you will implement a geocoder service to lookup a location by (partial) address or position from the API implemented on the Rails server, add geocoding to the Image editor to allow a user to specify the Image's position using an address, build a current origin component to express and retain the center origin and distance limits for future subject queries.UI Layout and Subjects PageIn this module you will add generic UI framework and Subject-specific components to implement a Subjects page that will show the user different views of Subjects (Things and Images) matching query criteria as well as the ability to express and depict the currently selected Subject.  As part of the UI framework you will implement a set of parent/child components to manage areas of the page and tabs within areas. You will make heavy use of transcludes to implement this visual layering and to encapsulate the details away from the Subject-based components. You will implement dynamic styling to shrink and expand areas as directed by the user.  As part of interacting with Subjects you will implement a Subjects page; divide the page up into sides, areas, and tabs; insert a set of Subject/view-specific components (e.g., lists, images, and details); integrate these components with a new Current Subjects service that will enable each of the components to maintain a consistent view of the user's query results and currently selected Subject. At the end of this module you will have implemented a complete UI framework -- ready to implement the visual display of Subjects using maps in the next module.MappingIn this module you will learn to display and interact with subjects on a map using the Google Javascript Map API. You will learn how to display a map, display markers on the map, customized markers to distinguish different types of subjects, and add display information windows for markers to indicate subject identity and image You will learn how to synchronize elements of the map with the other Subject components. You will learn to clear the map of markers, add new markers, activate marker(s) through a method call, and react to markers being clicked. This will complete our subjects page and course topics and leave you on the doorstep of building more interesting extensions to the example in the assignment.

Along the way, you will have the opportunity to put your game ideas in front of your peers and for the best-of-the-best you will have the chance to get feedback from game industry professionals. The capstone experience gives you the opportunity to push your skills further and demonstrate your newfound skills as a game developer. The capstone also contains guest talks from game industry professionals at Riot Games, Deep Silver Volition, Iron Galaxy, Radiant Entertainment, Goodgame Studios, Stardock, GREE, Heart Shaped Games, Kongregate, and more.","What's in the Capstone?Welcome to the Game Design and Development Capstone. In this module we'll give you a little bit of a sense of what to expect over the coming weeks. We're going to be honest with you though, this is going to be a fair amount of work. As you have learned, making games takes time and effort.  And the goal of the Capstone is to prove that you have the knowledge, skills, and attitude to make games. So, get ready to flex those game design and development muscles that you have developed across the specialization.Milestone 1: Your Game IdeaYou're going to notice a lot of overlap in terms of the kinds of activities we're asking you to do in this capstone and the things we already asked you to do in the previous courses. This isn't because we're lazy, it is because making games is how you get better at making games. So, the first thing you need to do is come up with a new idea. The next thing you need to do is convince us that it is worth giving you our time and hopefully money to explore that idea.Milestone 2: Early Prototype, Blueprint, and Progress ReportNow you have to start the process of making your game a reality. No matter how you do this, either as a non-digital prototype or a digital prototype, you need to start building and testing some of your core gameplay systems and mechanics.Milestone 3: First Playable and Fun Test (aka, playtest)The next step is to get something that you can start putting in front of people to begin getting feedback and working to ""find the fun."" Good luck.Milestone 4: Alpha BuildOnce you've found that core game idea, the next step is to begin building enough of it that it can begin feeling like a game. Your goal at this point is to continue iterating on that core game idea and build out enough features and content that you move beyond the prototyping phase (goodbye cubes and spheres) and on to something that really starts to look and feel like your game.It is Crunch Time!Now is the time to finish all the features, build all the levels, and begin polishing. You're not going to be done yet, but that's what you're working toward.Milestone 5: Beta Build and Beta TestingYou are in the final crunch leading up to the beta testing! Good luck and try to keep up your energy level with your project.Milestone 6: Ship It!Rule #1 of GameDev: If you don't ship, it doesn't exist. In this module, it is time to say, ""Enough is enough,"" and ship your game. We're literally asking you to create a final build of something and put it somewhere where the world can see it.
