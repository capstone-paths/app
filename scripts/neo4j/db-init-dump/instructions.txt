'data.dump' is a dump of the Neo4j database instance which has all scraped courses inserted as nodes and couple of researched sequences built in.

In order to initialize the Neo4j graph database from the dump you will need to do the following,

1. Find the location of,
a) Your Neo4j installation and the bin folder within it. This 'bin' folder has neo4j-admin utility which is needed to load
up the dump
b) 'data.dump' is the name of the database dump and you will need the path to this file.

2. From within in the Neo4j installation,
a) check status of database,
    ./bin/neo4j status.
b) If database is running you need to stop it,
    ./bin/neo4j stop

3. Take a copy of your current 'graph.db' which is within your Neo4j installation , path within in the installation is 'data/databases'.
I renamed 'graph.db' as 'graph_bk.db'

4. Now run the load script,
skeleton of the load script is as follows,
./bin/neo4j-admin load --from=<archive-path> --database=<database>

Example, The command I ran at my end -
./bin/neo4j-admin load --from=/Users/ajaykliyara/Documents/Capstone/db_dump/data.dump  --database=graph.db


5. Start the db,
./bin/neo4j start

6. Use 'http://localhost:7474/browser/' to access the database.

7. Run the below query in the browser to view one of the sequence,

match p=(n)-[r:NEXT*]->(m) where all(r in rels(p) where r.sequence_id="1") return p
